# -XX:\[+|-\]RequireJITServer

When you enable this option, the JITServer client crashes with an assert if it detects that a JITServer server is unavailable.

## Syntax

        -XX:[+|-]RequireJITServer

| Setting                 | Effect | Default                                                                            |
|-------------------------|--------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|`-XX:+RequireJITServer`           | Enable |                                                                                    |
|`-XX:-RequireJITServer`           | Disable| :fontawesome-solid-check:{: .yes aria-hidden="true"}<span class="sr-only">yes</span> |

## Explanation

This option is for debugging purposes only.

When this option is disabled, a server crash forces the client to perform compilations locally. You might want to enable this option if you are running a test suite with JITServer enabled, so that a test fails if the server crashes, instead of switching to local compilations and hiding the failure.
