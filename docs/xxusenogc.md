# -XX:\[+|-\]UseNoGC  

The `-XX:+UseNoGC` option enables a garbage collection policy that expands the Java object heap in the normal way until the limit is reached, but memory is not
reclaimed through garbage collection.

## Syntax

        -XX:[+|-]UseNoGC

| Setting                 | Effect | Default                                                                            |
|-------------------------|--------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|`-XX:+UseNoGC`           | Enable |                                                                                    |
|`-XX:-UseNoGC`           | Disable| <i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="sr-only">yes</span> |

## Explanation

This policy can be useful for test purposes and for short-lived applications. When the limit is reached an `OutOfMemory` error is generated and the VM shuts down.

The `-XX:-UseNoGC` option turns off a previously enabled `-XX:+UseNoGC` option.

This policy can also be enabled with the `-Xgcpolicy:nogc` option. See [`-Xgcpolicy:nogc`](xgcpolicy.md#nogc) for more details about this policy and when it is appropriate to use it.
