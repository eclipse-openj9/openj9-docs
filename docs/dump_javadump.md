# Java dump

Java dumps, sometimes referred to as *Java cores*, are produced when the VM ends unexpectedly because of an operating system signal, `OutOfMemoryError`, or a user-initiated keystroke combination. You can also generate a Java dump by calling the Dump API programmatically from your application or specifying the `-Xdump:java` option on the command line.

If your Java application crashes or hangs, Java dumps can provide useful information to help you diagnose the root cause.

- If your application crashes, Java dumps are generated automatically for the following types of failure:
    - the VM receives an unexpected signal or an assertion failure
    - the VM runs out of memory
- If your application hangs, you can trigger the generation of a Java dump by sending a SIGQUIT signal (`kill -3`) to the VM.

    <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Note:** On Windows, if you started the VM in a console window you can force the VM to produce a Java dump in response to a SIGBREAK signal
    (Ctrl-Break keyboard combination). If you didn't start in a console window there is no equivalent to a Linux `kill` command on Windows for sending signals.
    The only option here is to trigger a full system dump by finding the VM process in the **Processes** tab of the Windows Task Manager and clicking
    **Create dump file**.

To help you understand how a Java dump can help you with problem diagnosis, this topic includes a few scenarios to help you interpret the data:

- [A crash caused by a general protection fault (gpf)](#general-protection-fault)
- [A Java heap OutOfMemoryError (OOM)](#java-outofmemoryerror)
- [A native OutOfMemoryError (OOM)](#native-outofmemoryerror)
- [A deadlock situation](#deadlock)
- [A hang](#hang)

## Java dump contents

Java dumps summarize the state of the VM when the event occurs, with most of the information relating to components of the VM.
The file is made up of a number of sections that provide different types of information.

### TITLE

The first section of the Java dump file provides information about the event that triggered the production of the dump.
In the following example you can see that a `vmstop` event triggered the dump at a specified date and time.

```
0SECTION       TITLE subcomponent dump routine
NULL           ===============================

1TIPREPSTATE   Prep State: 0x106 (vm_access+exclusive_vm_access+trace_disabled)
```

### GPINFO

The GPINFO section provides general information about the system that the VM is running on. The following example is taken
from a Java dump that was generated on a Linux system.

```
NULL           ------------------------------------------------------------------------
0SECTION       GPINFO subcomponent dump routine
NULL           ================================
2XHOSLEVEL     OS Level         : Linux 3.10.0-862.11.6.el7.x86_64
2XHCPUS        Processors -
3XHCPUARCH       Architecture   : amd64
3XHNUMCPUS       How Many       : 4
3XHNUMASUP       NUMA is either not supported or has been disabled by user
NULL           
1XHERROR2      Register dump section only produced for SIGSEGV, SIGILL or SIGFPE.
NULL           
```

The content of this section can vary, depending on the cause of the dump. For example, if the dump was caused by a
general protection fault (gpf), the library in which the crash occurred is also recorded, together with a value shown
as `VM flags`. This value can provide some clues about which component of the VM might have been involved. Look for the
following line in the output:

```
1XHFLAGS       VM flags:0000000000000000
```

The hexadecimal number recorded for `VM flags` ends in MSSSS, where M is the VM component and SSSS is component-specific code as shown in the following table:

| Component     | Code value |
|---------------|------------|
| INTERPRETER   | 0x10000    |
| GC            | 0x20000    |
| GROW_STACK    | 0x30000    |
| JNI           | 0x40000    |
| JIT_CODEGEN   | 0x50000    |
| BCVERIFY      | 0x60000    |
| RTVERIFY      | 0x70000    |
| SHAREDCLASSES | 0x80000    |

A value of `0000000000000000` (0x00000) indicates that a crash occurred outside of the VM.

### ENVINFO

This section contains useful information about the environment in which the crash took place, including the following data:

- Java version (`1CIJAVAVERSION`)
- OpenJ9 VM and subcomponent version information (`1CIVMVERSION`, `1CIJ9VMVERSION`, `1CIJITVERSION`, `1CIOMRVERSION`, `1CIJCLVERSION`)
- VM start time (`1CISTARTTIME`) and process information (`1CIPROCESSID`)
- Java home (`1CIJAVAHOMEDIR`) and DLL (`1CIJAVADLLDIR`) directories
- User arguments passed on the command line (`1CIUSERARG`)
- User limits imposed by the system (`1CIUSERLIMITS`)
- Environment variables in place (`1CIENVVARS`)
- System information (`1CISYSINFO`)
- CPU information (`1CICPUINFO`)
- Control group (Cgroup) information (`1CICGRPINFO`)

### NATIVEMEMINFO

This section records information about native memory that is requested by using library functions such as `malloc()` and `mmap()`.
Values are provided as a breakdown, per component, indicating the total number of bytes allocated and the number of native memory allocations.
In the following example, 4,682,840 bytes of native memory are allocated (but not yet freed) to VM Classes, which corresponds to 141 allocations.

This section does not record memory that is allocated by application or JNI code and is typically a little less than the
value recorded by operating system tools.

### MEMINFO

This section relates to memory management, providing a breakdown of memory usage in the VM for the object heap,
internal memory, memory used for classes, the JIT code cache, and JIT data cache in decimal and hexadecimal format.
You can also find out which garbage collection policy is in use when the dump is produced.  

The object memory area (`1STHEAPTYPE`) records each memory region in use, its start and end address, and region size.
Further information is recorded about the memory segments used for internal memory, class memory, the JIT code cache and JIT data cache (`1STSEGMENT`).
This information includes the address of the segment control data structure, the start and end address of the native memory segment, as well as
the segment size.

For clarity, the following example shows a shortened version of this section, where `...` indicates that lines are removed:

a VM that is being diagnosed with the trace facility.

### LOCKS

This section of the Java dump provides information about locks, which protect shared resources from being accessed by more than one entity at a time. The information is essential in a deadlock situation, where two threads attempt to synchronize on an object and lock an instance of a class. Precise information is recorded about the threads that are causing the problem, which enables you to identify the root cause.

The following example shows a typical LOCKS section, where no deadlocks existed at the time the dump was triggered. For clarity, the following example shows a shortened version of this section, where `...` indicates that lines are removed:

### THREADS

The THREADS section of a Java dump file provides summary information about the VM thread pool and detailed information about Java threads, native threads, and stack traces. Understanding the content of this section can help you diagnose problems that are caused by blocked or waiting threads.

A Java thread runs on a native thread. Several lines are recorded for each Java thread in the `Thread Details` subsection, which include the following key pieces of information:

- `3XMTHREADINFO`: The thread name, address information for the VM thread structures and Java thread object, the thread state, and thread priority.
- `3XMJAVALTHREAD`: The Java thread ID and daemon status from the thread object.
- `3XMTHREADINFO1`: The native operating system thread ID, priority, scheduling policy, internal VM thread state, and VM thread flags.
- `3XMTHREADINFO2`: The native stack address range.
- `3XMTHREADINFO3`: Java callstack information (`4XESTACKTRACE`) or Native call stack information (`4XENATIVESTACK`).
- `5XESTACKTRACE`: This line indicates whether locks were taken by a specific method.

Java thread priorities are mapped to operating system priority values. Thread states are shown in the following table:

| Thread state value | Status         | Description                                     |
|--------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| R                  | Runnable       | The thread is able to run                       |
| CW                 | Condition Wait | The thread is waiting                           |
| S                  | Suspended      | The thread is suspended by another thread        |
| Z                  | Zombie         | The thread is destroyed                         |
| P                  | Parked         | The thread is parked by `java.util.concurrent`  |
| B                  | Blocked        | The thread is waiting to obtain a lock          |

For threads that are parked (P), blocked (B), or waiting (CW), an additional line (`3XMTHREADBLOCK`) is included in the output that shows what the thread is parked on, blocked on, or waiting for.

For clarity, the following example shows a shortened version of a typical THREADS section, where `...` indicates that lines are removed:

### HOOKS

This section shows internal VM event callbacks, which are used for diagnosing performance problems in the VM. Multiple hook interfaces are listed, which include their individual hook events.

The following example shows data for the `J9VMHookInterface`, including the total time for all previous events, the call site location (&lt;source file&gt;:&lt;line number&gt;), start time, and duration of the last callback and the longest callback (all times measured in microseconds). The hook data is reset after each Java dump.

### SHARED CLASSES

If the shared classes cache is enabled at run time, the information provided in a Java dump file describes settings that were used when creating the cache, together with summary information about the size and content of the cache.

In the following example, the shared classes cache was created with a Class Debug Area (`-Xnolinenumbers=false`). Byte code instrumentation (BCI) is enabled, which is the default, and VMs sharing the cache are allowed to store classpaths, which is also the default.

The `Cache Summary` shows a cache size (`2SCLTEXTCSZ`) of 16776608 bytes, with a soft maximum size (`2SCLTEXTSMB`) also of 16776608 bytes, which leaves 12691668 bytes of free space (`2SCLTEXTFRB`). The size of the Class Debug Area (`2SCLTEXTDAS`) is 1331200 bytes and only 11% of this space is used.

In the `Cache Memory Status` subsection, the line `2SCLTEXTCMDT` indicates the name and location of the shared cache and `cr` indicates that the cache is a 64-bit compressed references cache.

### CLASSES

The classes section shows information about class loaders. The first part is a summary that records each available class loader (`2CLTEXTCLLOADER`) followed by the number of libraries and classes that it loaded. This information is followed by a more detailed list of libraries (`1CLTEXTCLLIB`) and classes (`1CLTEXTCLLO`) that are loaded.

In the example you can see that the `java/lang/InternalAnonymousClassLoader` loaded 2 classes, `jdk/internal/loader/BuiltinClassLoader$$Lambda$2/00000000F03876A0(0x0000000001030F00)` and    			`jdk/internal/loader/BuiltinClassLoader$$Lambda$1/00000000F00D2460(0x0000000001018A00)`.

## Scenarios

### General Protection Fault

In this scenario, a Java application has crashed due to a General Protection Fault (GPF), automatically generating a Java dump file.

The first section of the file (TITLE) tells you that the GPF triggered the Java dump.

```
0SECTION       TITLE subcomponent dump routine
NULL           ===============================
1TICHARSET     UTF-8
1TISIGINFO     Dump Event "gpf" (00002000) received

1TIPREPSTATE   Prep State: 0x100 (trace_disabled)
1TIPREPINFO    Exclusive VM access not taken: data may not be consistent across javacore sections
```

To troubleshoot this problem, you need to know which thread caused the GPF to occur. The thread that was running at the time of the crash is reported as the **current thread**
in the THREADS section of the Java dump. Here is an extract from the THREADS section:

The extract tells you that the current thread was `java/lang/Thread`, and information is provided about the Java callstack and native callstack
(`3XMTHREADINFO3`) at the point at which the crash occurred. To simulate a crash caused by a bug in an application, this example
calls a JNI method whose native implementation causes a crash. The Java callstack shows the call to the JNI native method (`JNIcrasher`), and the
native callstack shows the point of failure. In this example, the native call stack does not include any function names to help you isolate the error
in the native code. You can get this information from a system dump, which is usually produced alongside the Java dump. Open the
system dump with the [Dump viewer](tool_jdmpview.md) and use the `info thread` command to print the Java and native stack for the current thread.

### Java OutOfMemoryError

In this scenario, the Java heap runs out of memory, causing an `OutOfMemoryError`, which automatically generates a Java dump file.

The first section of the file (TITLE) tells you that a `systhrow` event triggered the Java dump as a result of an OOM (`java/lang/OutOfMemoryError`) for
Java heap space.

```

The MEMINFO section records how much memory is allocated to the Java heap (`1STHEAPTYPE Object Memory`), how much is in use, and how much is free. Solving
your problem might be as simple as setting a larger heap size when you start your application.

If you don't know what size the Java heap was set to, you might find that information in the ENVINFO section, which records the command line options that
were used when the application started. Look or search for the `1CIUSERARGS    UserArgs:` string and review the entries recorded for all lines that
start `2CIUSERARG`. The Java heap size is set by the `-Xmx` option. If the size has not been set on the command line by `-Xmx`, the default value applies, which
you can find in [Default Settings](openj9_defaults.md).

In this scenario the solution to the problem is not an adjustment to the Java heap size. Here is the MEMINFO section:

```

1STHEAPFREE    Total memory free:    234267752 (0x0DF6A468)
```

The output shows that only 56% of the Java heap is in use, so this suggests that the application is trying to do something sub-optimal. To
investigate further you need to work out which thread was the current thread when the OOM occurred to see what it was trying to do. As in the previous scenario, you can find the
**current thread** in the THREADS section. Here is an extract from the output:

To simulate a Java `OutOfMemoryError`, this example application repeatedly appends characters to a `StringBuffer` object in an infinite loop. The Java callstack shows the `HeapBreaker.main` method appending characters (`java/lang/StringGuffer.append`) until the method `java/lang/StringBuffer.ensureCapacityImpl()` throws the `OutOfMemoryError`.

StringBuffer objects are wrappers for character arrays (`char[]`) and when the capacity of the underlying array is reached, the contents are automatically copied into a new, larger array. The new array is created in the `StringBuffer.ensureCapacity()` method, which more or less doubles the size of the old array. In this scenario, the array takes up all the remaining space in the Java heap.

The MEMINFO section of the Java dump file can also tell you when an unexpectedly large allocation request causes an OOM. Look for the GC History (`1STGCHTYPE`) section, which details allocation requests that trigger GC activity. In the sample output you can see that a large allocation request (`requestedbytes=603979784`) triggered a global GC. When the GC could not free up sufficient space in the heap to satisfy the request, the allocation failure generated the OOM.

```

Although the Java code that was used in this scenario deliberately triggered an `OutOfMemoryError` in a pronounced way, similar allocation issues can and do occur when dealing with large data sets such as XML files.

The next step in diagnosing the problem is to open the system dump that gets generated automatically when an `OutOfMemoryError` occurs. Open
the dump with the [Eclipse Memory Analyzer tool (MAT)](https://www.eclipse.org/mat/) and search for the `StringBuffer` object, which should provide further clues about what went wrong. A common example is seeing the same `String` duplicated over and over again, which might indicate that code is stuck in a loop.

  <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Note:** If you want to use MAT to analyze your system dump, you must install the Diagnostic Tool Framework for Java (DTFJ) plugin in the Eclipse IDE. Select the following menu items:

```
Help > Install New Software > Work with "IBM Diagnostic Tool Framework for Java" >  
```

If, unlike the previous scenario, you receive an `OutOfMemoryError` and the MEMINFO section shows that there is very little space left
on the Java heap, the current thread information is typically not important. The current thread is simply the thread that happened to be current when the space ran out. In this situation you might want to increase your Java heap size. For help with this task, see [How to do heap sizing](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_8.0.0/com.ibm.java.vm.80.doc/docs/mm_heapsizing.html).


### Native OutOfMemoryError


In this scenario, the VM runs out of native memory. Native memory is memory that is used by the VM for storing all virtualized resources and data that it needs for VM operations. Native memory that is available to the VM process is limited by the operating system. The native memory available to the VM might also be subject to additional limits imposed by the operating system, for example Unix `ulimits`.  

When a `NativeOutOfMemoryError` occurs, a Java dump is generated by default. The first section of the file (TITLE) tells you that a systhrow event triggered the Java dump as a result of an OOM (`java/lang/OutOfMemoryError`) for native memory.

For clarity in the `Native callstack` output, `...` indicates that some lines are removed.

The Java callstack shows the transition from Java to native code (`sun/misc/Unsafe.allocateDBBMemory(Native Method)`), indicating a request for Direct Byte Buffer (DBB) storage. DBB storage is backed by native memory, with the Java heap containing only a reference to the native heap buffer. In this scenario, DBB storage is the likely culprit for this `NativeOutOfMemoryError`.

The next step is to investigate the NATIVEMEMINFO section of the Java dump file, which reports the amount of memory used by the JRE process, broken down into component areas.

```

In the `VM Class Libraries` section, the amount of memory allocated for `Direct Byte Buffers` is shown. Because the `NativeOutOfMemoryError` was received on a small 32-bit system, a value of `2,598,510,480 bytes` indicates that the operating system has run out of memory. On a larger UNIX system, the process might have run out of memory because of the `ulimit` setting. Increasing the value for `ulimit` might avoid the error, which you can do temporarily by setting  `ulimit -f unlimited` in your current session.

The theoretical maximum size for a 32-bit process is the size of the 32-bit address space, which is 4 GB. On most operating systems a portion of the address space for each process is used by the kernel, such that the real limit for 32-bit processes is actually significantly less than 4GB. As a result, running out of native memory with a 32-bit VM is quite common.

The same 4 GB limit is also important if you are using a 64-bit VM with compressed references. In compressed references mode, all references to objects, classes, threads, and monitors are represented by 32-bit values for performance reasons, so these structures can be allocated only at 32-bit addresses. However, the operating system might place other allocations within this 4 GB of address space, and if this area becomes sufficiently full or fragmented, the VM throws a native `NativeOutOfMemoryError` error. These errors typically occur when the VM tries to create a new thread or load a class. The **Current Thread History** section should contain more information about what the thread was doing at the VM level when the `NativeOutOfMemoryError` error occurred.

You can usually avoid this type of problem by using the `-Xmcrs` option to reserve a contiguous area of memory within the lowest 4GB of memory at VM startup.

Another common cause of a `NativeOutOfMemoryError` is when an application loads duplicate classes. Classes are allocated outside of the Java heap in native memory. If the value reported for `Classes` in the NATIVEMEMINFO section is very large, duplicate classes might be the cause of your problem. The [Eclipse Memory Analyzer Tool (MAT)](https://www.eclipse.org/mat/) can tell you if you have duplicate classes by using the *Class Loader Explorer* feature. Because a system dump is automatically generated as well as a Java dump in response to a `NativeOutOfMemoryError`, simply open the system dump in MAT to continue your diagnosis.  


### Deadlock

Deadlocks occur when two threads attempt to synchronize on an object and lock an instance of a class. When this happens, your application stops responding and hangs. Generating a Java dump file will quickly tell you whether you have a deadlock situation. Trigger the Java dump by sending a SIGQUIT signal (`kill -3`) to the VM.

The VM can detect the most common types of deadlock scenario involving Java monitors. If this type of deadlock is detected, information is provided in the LOCKS section. More complex deadlocks, including those that involve a mixture of native mutexes and Java monitors, are not detected.

Here is the output from the code that was used to cause a common deadlock scenario:

```
NULL

3LKDEADLOCKOWN    which is owned by:
2LKDEADLOCKTHR  Thread "Worker Thread 2" (0x94501D00)
```

This output tells you that `Worker Thread 2` is waiting for `Worker Thread 3`, which is waiting for `Worker Thread 1`. Because `Worker Thread 1` is also waiting for `Worker Thread 2`, there is a deadlock. The next place to look is the output for Java and native stacks, in the THREADS section. By looking at the stack for each of these worker threads you can trace the problem back to specific lines in your application code.

In this example, you can see from the following output that for all worker threads, the stack traces (`4XESTACKTRACE`/`5XESTACKTRACE`) indicate a problem in line 35 of the application `DeadLockTest.java`:

### Hang

An application can hang for a number of reasons but the most common cause is excessive global garbage collection (GC) activity, where your application is repeatedly paused because your Java heap has *almost* run out of memory. You can identify this problem by looking at verbose GC output. Collect this output by specifying the `-verbose:gc` option.

Deadlock situations can also manifest themselves as hangs. For more information on diagnosing this type of problem from a Java dump, see the [deadlock](#deadlock) scenario.

If you have eliminated verbose GC activity and deadlocks, another common hang scenario involves threads that compete and wait for Java object locks. This type of problem can usually be diagnosed by examining a Java dump. The simplest hang scenario involving Java object locks is where a thread acquires a lock that other threads are waiting for, but it doesn't release the lock for some reason.

The first place to look in the Java dump output is the **LOCKS** section. This section lists all the monitors and shows which threads have acquired a lock and which threads are waiting. If the hang is caused by a thread not releasing a lock that other threads need, you can see a list of waiting threads in the output.

In this example scenario, the Java dump **LOCKS** section shows that `Worker Thread 0` (`3LKMONOBJECT`) has acquired a lock and there are 19 other worker threads waiting to obtain the lock.

```

The next step is to determine why `Worker Thread 0` is not releasing the lock. The best place to start is the stack trace for this thread, which you can find by searching on the thread name or J9VMThread ID in the **THREADS** section.

The following extract shows the details for `"Worker Thread 0" (J9VMThread:0x92A3EC00)`:

```
NULL
3XMTHREADINFO      "Worker Thread 0" J9VMThread:0x92A3EC00, omrthread_t:0x92A3C280, java/lang/Thread:0xB56668B8, state:CW, prio=5

4XESTACKTRACE                at java/lang/Thread.sleep(Thread.java:941)
4XESTACKTRACE                at WorkerThread.doWork(HangTest.java:37)
4XESTACKTRACE                at WorkerThread.run(HangTest.java:31)
5XESTACKTRACE                   (entered lock: java/lang/Object@0xB56658D8, entry count: 1)
```

In the last line of this output you can see where the thread acquired the lock. Working up from this line, you can see that `WorkerThread.run` was called, which in turn called `WorkerThread.doWork`. The stack shows that the thread then entered a call to `java/lang/Thread.sleep` in HangTest.java on line 37, which is preventing the thread from completing its work and releasing the lock. In this example the `sleep` call was added to induce a hang, but in real-world scenarios the cause could be any blocking operation, such as reading from an input stream or socket. Another possibility is that the thread is waiting for *another* lock owned by yet another thread.

It is important to remember that each Java dump represents a single snapshot in time. You should generate at least three Java dumps separated by a short pause, for example 30 seconds, and compare the output. This comparison tells you whether the threads involved are stuck in a fixed state or whether they are moving.

In this example, the threads do not move and the investigation needs to focus on the logic in `WorkerThread.doWork` to understand why `Worker Thread 0` entered the `java/lang/Thread.sleep` call.

Another common scenario is where each Java dump shows a number of threads waiting for a lock owned by another thread, but the list of waiting threads and the lock-owning thread change over time. In this case the cause is likely to be a bottleneck caused by thread contention, where the threads are continually competing for the same lock. In severe cases, the lock is held only for a small amount of time but there are lots of threads trying to obtain it. Because more time is spent handling the lock and scheduling the thread than executing application code, the degradation in performance is manifested as a hang. Thread contention is usually caused by an application design problem. You can use a similar approach to the one used in this scenario to determime which lines of code are responsible for the contention.
