# -Xmoi

Sets the heap expansion allocation increment.

You can use the `-verbose:sizes` option to find out the values that the VM is currently using.

## Syntax

| Setting       | Effect                                            | Default                   |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `-Xmoi<size>` | Sets the heap expansion allocation increment      | See **Notes**              |


:fontawesome-solid-pencil-alt:{: .note aria-hidden="true"} **Notes:**

- By default, the increment size (`-Xmoi`) is calculated on the expansion size, set by [`-Xmine`](xmine.md) and [`-Xminf`](xminf.md).  If you set `-Xmoi` to zero, no expansion is allowed.
- For the `gencon` GC policy, the expansion increment applies to the tenure area of the heap.  

This option is not supported for the `metronome` GC policy, because the heap is always fully expanded.

See [Using -X command-line options](x_jvm_commands.md) for more information about the `<size>` parameter.
