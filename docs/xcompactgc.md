# -Xcompactgc / -Xnocompactgc


Enables or disables full compaction on system and global garbage collection (GC) activities.

## Syntax

| Setting        | Action                  |
|----------------|-------------------------|
|`-Xcompactgc`   | Enable full compaction  |
|`-Xnocompactgc` | Disable full compaction |


## Default behavior

If a compaction option is not specified, the garbage collector compacts based on a series of triggers. These triggers attempt to compact only when it is beneficial to the future performance of the VM.

These options are not applicable to the following GC policies:

- balanced GC policy (`-Xgcpolicy:balanced`): compaction is always enabled.
- metronome GC policy (`-Xgcpolicy:metronome`): compaction is not supported.
