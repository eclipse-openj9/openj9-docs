# -Xcompactgc / -Xnocompactgc 


Enables or disables full compaction on all garbage collections (system and global).

## Syntax

| Setting        | Action                  |
|----------------|-------------------------|
|`-Xcompactgc`   | Enable full compaction  |
|`-Xnocompactgc` | Disable full compaction |


## Default behavior

If no compaction option is specified, the garbage collector compacts based on a series of triggers that attempt to compact only when it is beneficial to the future performance of the OpenJ9 VM.
