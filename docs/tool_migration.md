# Switching to OpenJ9

OpenJ9 provides the following tools, which might differ in behavior from the HotSpot equivalent.

<i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Note:** For information about HotSpot equivalences and differences for items other than tools, see [New to OpenJ9?](openj9_newuser.md)

#### Java diagnostic command tool (`jcmd`)

Runs diagnostic commands on a specified VM. The main difference from the HotSpot `jcmd` tool is that the following options are not currently supported:

- The `-f` option to read commands from a file.
- The `Perfcounter.print` option for displaying performance counters for the target VM.
- Selecting VMs by main class instead of VMID.
- Specifying `0` as a VMID to target all VMs.

#### Java memory map tool (`jmap`)

Displays information about classes on the heap, including the number of objects and their aggregate size. The main differences from the HotSpot `jmap` tool are as follows:

- Uses the Attach API.
- Displays information only for local processes that are owned by the current user, due to security considerations. You can display information for remote processes by using `ssh user@host jmap <option> <vmid>`, where `<vmid>` is the Attach API virtual machine identifier for the Java&trade; process.
- Does not support displaying data from core dumps; use [Dump viewer](tool_jdmpview.md) instead.
- Does not include a `-F` option to force a dump of an unresponsive process. User `kill -QUIT <pid>` instead, where `<pid>` is the process
identifier.

For more information, see [`jmap`](tool_jmap.md).

#### Java process status (`jps`)

Displays information about running Java processes. The main differences from the HotSpot `jps` tool are as follows:

- Runs on Windows&reg;, AIX&reg;, and z/OS&reg;, as well as Linux&reg;.
- Uses the Attach API.
- Shows processes on the current host only.
- There is no `-V` option.

For more information, see [`Java process status`](tool_jps.md).

#### Java stack (`jstack`) tool

Displays information about Java stack traces and thread information for processes. The main differences from the HotSpot `jstack` tool are as follows:

- In the interests of security, the OpenJ9 implementation of `jstack` prints only information about local processes that are owned by the current user.
- Printing data for core dumps is not supported. Use the [Dump viewer](tool_jdmpview.md) instead.
- There is no `-m` option. Printing data for native stack frames is not supported.
- There is no `-F` option to force a dump, although this might be accomplished using `kill -QUIT <pid>` on some platforms.

For more information, see [`jstack`](tool_jstack.md).

#### Java statistics monitoring (`jstat`) tool

Displays information about Java statistics for processes. The main difference from the HotSpot `jstat` tool is that this tool only provides the number of classes loaded and the number of class unloaded.

For more information, see [`jstat`](tool_jstat.md).
