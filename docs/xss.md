# -Xiss / -Xss / -Xssi

Sets the stack size and increment for Java&trade; threads.

If you exceed the maximum Java thread stack size, a `java/lang/OutOfMemoryError` message is reported.

You can use the `-verbose:sizes` option to find out the values that the VM is currently using.

:fontawesome-solid-pencil-alt:{: .note aria-hidden="true"} **Note:** Java methods and native methods run on two different stacks and the VM handles switching between them for JNI calls. Each stack is sized using separate options; these options apply to the Java stack only. For the native stack option, see the link in the [See also](#see-also) section.

## Syntax

| Setting       | Effect                               | Default                              |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `-Xiss<size>` | Set initial Java thread stack size   | 2 KB                                 |
| `-Xss<size>`  | Set maximum Java thread stack size   | 320 KB (31/32-bit); 1024 KB (64-bit) |
| `-Xssi<size>` | Set Java thread stack size increment | 16 KB                                |

See [Using -X command-line options](x_jvm_commands.md) for more information about the `<size>` parameter.  

See [Default settings for the OpenJ9 VM](openj9_defaults.md) for more about default values.
