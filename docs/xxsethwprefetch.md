# -XXsetHWPrefetch  

**(AIX&reg; only)**

This option enables or disables hardware prefetch. Hardware prefetch can improve the performance of applications by prefetching memory. However, because of the workload characteristics of many Java&trade; applications, prefetching often has an adverse effect on performance.

## Syntax

        -XXsetHWPrefetch=[none|os-default]

| Setting    | Effect  | Default                                                                            |
|------------|---------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| none       | Disable | <i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="sr-only">yes</span> |
| os-default | Enable  |                                                                                    |

The `-XXsetHWPrefetch:none` option disables hardware prefetch. Although you can disable hardware prefetch on AIX by issuing the command `dscrctl -n -s 1`, this command disables hardware prefetch for all processes, and for all future processes, which might not be desirable in a mixed workload environment. The `-XXsetHWPrefetch:none` option allows hardware prefetch to be disabled for individual VMs.

To enable hardware prefetch with the default value for the operating system, specify `-XXsetHWPrefetch:os-default`. Use this option only for applications that can obtain a performance gain from hardware prefetch.
