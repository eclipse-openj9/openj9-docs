# -XX:\[+|-\]HandleSIGXFSZ

**(AIX&reg;, Linux&reg;, macOS&reg;, and z/OS&reg; only)**

This option affects the handling of the operating system signal `SIGXFSZ`. This signal is generated when a process attempts to write to a file that causes the maximum file size `ulimit` to be exceeded.


## Syntax

        -XX:[+|-]HandleSIGXFSZ

| Setting               | Effect  | Default                                                                            |
|-----------------------|---------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| `-XX:+HandleSIGXFSZ ` | Enable  | <i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="sr-only">yes</span> |
| `-XX:-HandleSIGXFSZ ` | Disable |                                                                                    |


## Explanation

When enabled, the VM handles the signal `SIGXFSZ` and continues, without ending. When a file is written from a Java&trade; API class that exceeds the maximum file size `ulimit`, an exception is raised. Log files that are created by the VM are silently truncated when they reach the maximum file size `ulimit`.

When the option is disabled, the VM does not handle the signal `SIGXFSZ`. In this situation, if the maximum file size `ulimit` for any file is reached, the operating system ends the process with a core dump.
