# -XX:InitialRAMPercentage / -XX:MaxRAMPercentage

These Oracle HotSpot options can be used to specify the initial and maximum size of the Java heap as a percentage of the total memory available to the VM. The options are recognized by OpenJ9 and provided for compatibility.

## Syntax

| Setting                      | Effect                                                 |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `-XX:InitialRAMPercentage=N` | Set initial heap size as a percentage of total memory  |
| `-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=N`     | Set maximum heap size as a percentage of total memory  |

: Where N is a value between 0 and 100, which can be of type "double". For example, 12.3456.

:fontawesome-solid-pencil-alt:{: .note aria-hidden="true"} **Note:** If you set a value for [`-Xms`](xms.md), the `-XX:InitialRAMPercentage` option is ignored.
If you set a value for [`-Xmx`](xms.md), the `-XX:MaxRAMPercentage` option is ignored.

If your application is running in a container and you have specified [`-XX:+UseContainerSupport`](xxusecontainersupport.md), both the default heap size for containers, the `-XX:InitialRAMPercentage` option, and the `-XX:MaxRAMPercentage` option are based on the available container memory.
