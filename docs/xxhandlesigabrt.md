# -XX:\[+|-\]HandleSIGABRT

This option affects the handling of the operating system signal `SIGABRT`. This signal represents abnormal termination, and it can either be generated by the `abort` function or the `kill` command.


## Syntax

        -XX:[+|-]HandleSIGABRT

| Setting               | Effect  | Default                                                                            |
|-----------------------|---------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| `-XX:+HandleSIGABRT ` | Enable  | :fontawesome-solid-check:{: .yes aria-hidden="true"}<span class="sr-only">yes</span> |
| `-XX:-HandleSIGABRT ` | Disable |                                                                                    |


## Explanation

When enabled, the VM handles the signal `SIGABRT` and generates the various dump files. 

When the option is disabled, the VM does not handle the signal `SIGABRT`. Generally, this signal is handled by the default operating system handler.

:fontawesome-solid-pencil:{: .note aria-hidden="true"} **Note:** Do not use the `-XX:+HandleSIGABRT` and [`-Xrs`](xrs.md) options together. An error is thrown if both options are enabled. To resolve this error, one of the options should be disabled.
