# -XX:\[+|-\]EnsureHashed

Objects allocated from the specified classes will be hashed and extended with a slot to store the hash upon object creation or first move. This option may improve performance for applications that frequently hash objects of a certain type.

## Syntax

        -XX:+EnsureHashed:<classes>
        -XX:-EnsureHashed:<classes>

| Setting                     | Effect           |
|-----------------------------|------------------|
|`-XX:+EnsureHashed:<classes>`| Specify classes  |
|`-XX:-EnsureHashed:<classes>`| Unspecify classes|

Where `<classes>` is a comma-separated list of fully qualified class names, e.g. `java/lang/String`.

The `-XX:+EnsureHashed:<classes>` option specifies the classes and the `-XX:-EnsureHashed:<classes>` option unspecifies classes that were previously specified. These options are parsed left to right.

For example, `-XX:+EnsureHashed:Class1,Class2,Class3 -XX:-EnsureHashed:Class2 -XX:+EnsureHashed:Class2,Class4 -XX:-EnsureHashed:Class1,Class3` results in the set of `EnsureHashed` classes {`Class2`, `Class4`}.
