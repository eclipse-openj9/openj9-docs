# -Xfuture

As described in the [Oracle "Non-Standard Options" documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/java.html#BABHDABI), this HotSpot option turns on strict class-file format checks. For compatibility, this option is also supported by the OpenJ9 VM.

## Syntax

        -Xfuture

## Explanation

Oracle recommend that you use this flag when you are developing new code because stricter checks will become the default in future releases.

:fontawesome-solid-pencil-alt:{: .note aria-hidden="true"} **Note:** You cannot use this setting in conjunction with [-XX:+ClassRelationshipVerifier](xxclassrelationshipverifier.md). 

## Default behavior

By default, strict format checks are disabled.
