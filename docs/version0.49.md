# What's new in version 0.49.0

The following new features and notable changes since version 0.48.0 are included in this release:

- [New binaries and changes to supported environments](#binaries-and-supported-environments)
- [Change to the shared classes cache generation number](#change-to-the-shared-classes-cache-generation-number)
- [`-Xgc` options for suballocator heap size added to control the compressed reference allocation](#xgc-options-for-suballocator-heap-size-added-to-control-the-compressed-reference-allocation)

## Features and changes

### Binaries and supported environments

Eclipse OpenJ9&trade; release 0.49.0 supports OpenJDK 8, 11, 17, 21, and 23.

macOS 12 is out of support and is removed from the list of supported platforms.

To learn more about support for OpenJ9 releases, including OpenJDK levels and platform support, see [Supported environments](openj9_support.md).

### Change to the shared classes cache generation number

The shared classes cache generation number is incremented. The increment in the shared classes cache generation number causes the VM to create a new shared classes cache, rather than re-creating or reusing an existing cache.

To save space, all existing shared caches can be removed unless they are in use by an earlier release. For more information, see [Housekeeping](shrc.md#housekeeping) and [`-Xshareclasses`](xshareclasses.md).

The shared classes cache generation number is modified because of a change in the format of ROMClasses that are stored in the shared classes cache. A new flag `J9AccClassIsShared` is added to ROMClasses to indicate whether a ROMClass was loaded from a shared classes cache or from a VM.

### `-Xgc` options for suballocator heap size added to control the compressed reference allocation

The VM can use compressed references to decrease the size of Java objects and make better use of the available space in the Java heap. You can now control the compressed reference allocation with the following options:

 - [`-Xgc:suballocatorCommitSize=<bytes>`](xgc.md#suballocatorcommitsize)
 - [`-Xgc:suballocatorIncrementSize=<bytes>`](xgc.md#suballocatorincrementsize)
 - [`-Xgc:suballocatorInitialSize=<bytes>`](xgc.md#suballocatorinitialsize)
 - [`-Xgc:suballocatorQuickAllocDisable`](xgc.md#suballocatorquickallocdisable)
 - [`-Xgc:suballocatorQuickAllocEnable`](xgc.md#suballocatorquickallocenable)

For more information, see [Compressed references](allocation.md#compressed-references).
