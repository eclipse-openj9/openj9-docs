# -Xverify

As described in the [Oracle documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/java.html), this HotSpot option enables or disables the verifier. For compatibility, this option is also supported by the OpenJ9 VM.

## Syntax 

| Setting           | Effect | Default |
|-------------------|--------|:-------:|
| `-Xverify`        | Enables verification for all non-bootstrap classes. [`-Xfuture`](xfuture.md) verification is not enabled. | <i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="sr-only">yes</span> |
| `-Xverify:all`    | Enables verification for all classes and enables [`-Xfuture`](xfuture.md) verification. &nbsp; You cannot use this setting in conjunction with [-XX:+ClassRelationshipVerifier](xxclassrelationshipverifier.md). &nbsp; **Note:** This setting might have an impact on performance. | |
| `-Xverify:remote` | For compatibility, this parameter is accepted, but is equivalent to the default `-Xverify`. | |
| `-Xverify:none`   | Disables the verifier. &nbsp; **Note:** This is not a supported configuration and, as noted, was deprecated from Java 13. If you encounter problems with the verifier turned off, remove this option and try to reproduce the problem. | |

![Start of content that applies to Java 13 and later](cr/java13plus.png) <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Note:** The option `-Xverify:none` (and its equivalent `-noverify`) was deprecated in Java 13. Both options might be removed in a future release. OpenJ9 issues a warning if these options are used in Java 13 and later versions. ![End of content that applies only to Java 13](cr/java_close.png)
