# Directory conventions

The following tables provide a quick reference to the OpenJ9 VM directory location on different Java&trade; versions and different platform architectures. Some
pages refer to the VM directory location as `<vm_dir>`.


| Operating system | Java 8                                  | Java 11 and later                          |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| AIX&reg;         | `<install_dir>/jre/lib/ppc[64]/default` | `<install_dir>/` |
| Linux&reg;       | `<install_dir>/jre/lib/<arch>/default`  | `<install_dir>/` |
| macOS&reg;        | `<install_dir>/jre/lib/default`         | `<install_dir>/` |
| Windows&trade;   | `<install_dir>\jre\bin\default`         | `<install_dir>\` |
| z/OS&reg;        | `<install_dir>/jre/lib/s390[x]/default` | `<install_dir>/` |

Where:

- `<install_dir>` is your JDK installation directory.
- `<arch>` depends on the architecture your Linux distribution is running on. See the following table for possible values:

| Architecture                                       | Value of `<arch>`     |
|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| x86 32-bit                                         | `i386`                |
| x86 64-bit                                         | `x86-64`              |
| IBM POWER&reg; 32-bit (Big Endian)      | `ppc`                 |
| IBM POWER 64-bit (Big Endian)                      | `ppc64`               |
| IBM POWER 64-bit (Little Endian)                   | `ppc64le`             |
| IBM Z&reg; 31-bit                       | `s390`                |
| IBM Z 64-bit                                       | `s390x`               |
