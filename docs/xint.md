# -Xint

As described in the [Oracle "Non-Standard Options" documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/java.html#BABHDABI), this VM option runs an application in interpreted-only mode. For compatibility, this option is also supported by the OpenJ9 VM.

## Syntax

        -Xint

## Explanation

If you use this option, the OpenJ9 VM uses only the interpreter, disabling the OpenJ9 just-in-time (JIT) and ahead-of-time (AOT) compilers. By default, both these compilers are enabled, although the AOT compiler is not used by the VM unless [shared classes](xshareclasses.md) are also enabled.
