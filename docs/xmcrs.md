# -Xmcrs 


Sets an initial size for an area in memory that is reserved for any native classes, monitors, and threads that are used by compressed references within the lowest 4 GB memory area.

You can use the `-verbose:sizes` option to find out the value that is being used by the VM.

:fontawesome-solid-pencil-alt:{: .note aria-hidden="true"} **Notes:** 

- Native memory `OutOfMemoryError` exceptions might occur when using compressed references if the lowest 4 GB of address space becomes full, particularly when loading classes, starting threads, or using monitors. 
- If you are not using compressed references and this option is set, the option is ignored and the output of `-verbose:sizes` shows `-Xmcrs0`.



## Syntax

        -Xmcrs<size>

See [Using -X command-line options](x_jvm_commands.md) for more information about the `<size>` parameter.
