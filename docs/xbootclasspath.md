# -Xbootclasspath

This Oracle&reg; HotSpot&trade; option specifies the search path for bootstrap classes and resources. The default is to search for bootstrap classes and resources in the internal VM directories and `.jar` files. The option is recognized by the OpenJ9 VM.

## Syntax

|Limited to...       | Setting                   | Effect                                                                   |
|--------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|![](cr/java8.png)  |`-Xbootclasspath:<path>`   |Sets the search path for bootstrap classes and resources.                 |
|![](cr/java8.png)  |`-Xbootclasspath/p:<path>` |Prepends the specified resources to the front of the bootstrap class path.|
|                    |`-Xbootclasspath/a:<path>` |Appends the specified resources to the end of the bootstrap class path.   |

: where `<path>` represents directories and compressed or Java&trade; archive files separated with colons (:). On Windows&trade; systems, use a semicolon (;) as a separator.

![](cr/java8.png) Oracle advise that you should "not deploy applications that use this option to override a class in `rt.jar`, because this violates the JRE binary code license."
