# -Xlp:objectheap


Requests the OpenJ9 VM to allocate the Java&trade; object heap by using large page sizes.

To find out the large page sizes available and the current setting, use the `-verbose:sizes` option. Note that the current settings are the requested sizes and not the sizes obtained. For object heap size information, check the `-verbose:gc` output.

## Syntax

AIX&reg;, Linux&reg;, macOS&reg;, and Windows&trade;:

        -Xlp:objectheap:pagesize=<size>[,strict|warn]

z/OS&reg;:

        -Xlp:objectheap:pagesize=<size>[,strict|warn][,pageable|nonpageable]

See [Using -X command-line options](x_jvm_commands.md) for more information about the `<size>` parameter.

## Parameters

### `pagesize`

        -Xlp:objectheap:pagesize=<size>

: The large page size that you require.

    If the operating system does not have sufficient resources to satisfy the request, the page size you requested might not be available when the VM starts up. By default, the VM starts and the Java object heap is allocated by using a different platform-defined page size. Alternatively, you can use the `strict` or `warn` suboptions to customize behavior.

#### Default page sizes

: On Linux systems, the default size for the object heap depends on the architecture:

    - Linux on x86 and AMD64/EM64T systems: 2 MB large pages
    - Linux on IBM Z&reg;: 1 MB large pages
    - On other architectures, the VM uses the default operating system page size.

: On macOS, the default page size is 4 KB.

### `strict` | `warn`

        -Xlp:objectheap:strict
        -Xlp:objectheap:warn

:    -   `strict` causes an error message to be generated if large pages are requested but cannot be obtained. This option causes the VM to end.
    -   `warn` causes a warning message to be generated if large pages are requested but cannot be obtained. This option allows the VM to continue.

    <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Note:** If both `strict` and `warn` are specified, `strict` takes precedence.

### `pageable`|`nonpageable`

        -Xlp:objectheap:pageable
        -Xlp:objectheap:nonpageable

: On z/OS systems, defines the type of memory to allocate for the Java object heap.

    1 MB pageable pages, when available, are the default size for the object heap.  
    Supported large page sizes are 2 GB nonpageable, 1 MB nonpageable, and 1 MB pageable. A page size of 4 KB can also be used.
