# Java stack (`jstack`) tool

Use the `jstack` tool to obtain Java stack traces and thread information for processes. The tool is similar to the HotSpot tool of the same name; the OpenJ9 version of `jstack` is an independent implementation, added for compatibility.

The command syntax is as follows:

    jstack <options>* <pid>*

Where `<pid>*` is a list of process IDs. If none are supplied, the process IDs are read from `stdin`, which allows a user running a Bourne or equivalent shell to query all processes via `jps -q | jstack`. IDs of inactive processes are silently ignored. The output contains Java stacks and thread information of the specified processes (equivalent to the information provided in `java.lang.management.ThreadInfo`).

The values for `<options>*` are as follows:

- `-J`: supplies arguments to the Java VM that is running the `jstack` command. You can use multiple `-J` options, for example: `jstack -J-Xmx10m -J-Dcom.ibm.tools.attach.enable=yes`
- `-p`: prints the system and agent properties of the process
- `-l`: prints more verbose output, including information about locks
- `-h`: prints help information


:fontawesome-solid-exclamation-triangle:{: .warn aria-hidden="true"} **Restrictions:**

- This tool is not supported and is subject to change or removal in future releases.
- Although similar in usage and output to the HotSpot tool of the same name, this tool is a different implementation that is specific to OpenJ9. For more information about differences, see [Switching to OpenJ9](tool_migration.md).
