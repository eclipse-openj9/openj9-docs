# -XcompilationThreads 


Use this option to specify the number of compilation threads that are used by the JIT compiler.

## Syntax

        -XcompilationThreads<n>

: where `<n>` is the number of threads, in the range 1-7 inclusive. Any number outside this range is ignored.
: Setting the compilation threads to zero does not prevent the JIT from working. Instead, if you do not want the JIT to work, use the [`-Xint`](xint.md) option.

: The default number of compilation threads is determined by the internal JIT heuristics that take into consideration the number of CPUs the JVM is allowed to use.

![Start of content that applies to Java 8+](cr/java8plus.png) Starting with OpenJ9 release 0.33.0, the maximum number of compilation threads is 15. When operating in the JITServer mode, the maximum number of compilation threads is 999, while the default value is 63.

## Explanation

When multiple compilation threads are used, the JIT might generate several diagnostic log files. A log file is generated for each compilation thread. The naming convention for the log file generated by the first compilation thread uses the following pattern:

    <specified_filename>.<date>.<time>.<pid>

The first compilation thread has ID 0. Log files generated by the second and subsequent compilation threads append the ID of the corresponding compilation thread as a suffix to the log file name. The pattern for these log file names is as follows:

    <specified_filename>.<date>.<time>.<pid>.<compilation_thread_ID>

For example, the second compilation thread has ID 1. The result is that the corresponding log file name has the form:

    <specified_filename>.<date>.<time>.<pid>.1
