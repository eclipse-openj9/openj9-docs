# -XcompilationThreads 


Use this option to specify the number of compilation threads that are used by the JIT compiler.

## Syntax

        -XcompilationThreads<n>

: where `<n>` is the number of threads, in the range 1-7 inclusive. Any number outside this range is ignored. 

: Setting the compilation threads to zero does not prevent the JIT from working. Instead, if you do not want the JIT to work, use the [`-Xint`](xint.md) option.

## Explanation

When multiple compilation threads are used, the JIT might generate several diagnostic log files. A log file is generated for each compilation thread. The naming convention for the log file generated by the first compilation thread uses the following pattern:

    <specified_filename>.<date>.<time>.<pid>

The first compilation thread has ID 0. Log files generated by the second and subsequent compilation threads append the ID of the corresponding compilation thread as a suffix to the log file name. The pattern for these log file names is as follows:

    <specified_filename>.<date>.<time>.<pid>.<compilation_thread_ID>

For example, the second compilation thread has ID 1. The result is that the corresponding log file name has the form:

    <specified_filename>.<date>.<time>.<pid>.1
