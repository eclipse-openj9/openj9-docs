# -XX:\[+|-\]PageAlignDirectMemory

This Oracle HotSpot option affects the alignment of direct byte buffer allocation and is implemented by the OpenJ9 VM for compatibility.

## Syntax

        -XX:[+|-]PageAlignDirectMemory

| Setting                      | Effect  | Default                                                                            |
|------------------------------|---------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| `-XX:+PageAlignDirectMemory` | Enable  |                                                                                    |
| `-XX:-PageAlignDirectMemory` | Disable | <i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="sr-only">yes</span> |

As discussed in the Oracle documentation, before Java&trade; SE 7, direct buffers that were allocated using `java.nio.ByteBuffer.allocateDirect(int)` were aligned on a page boundary. This behavior changed in Java SE 7 and the `-XX:+PageAlignDirectMemory` option is provided to revert to the previous behavior.

For more information about the changes, see [RFE 4837564](http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4837564), which was introduced in the [Java SE 7 release notes](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/jdk7-relnotes-418459.html).
