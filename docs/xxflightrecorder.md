# -XX:[+|-]FlightRecorder

![Start of content that applies to Java 11 (LTS) and later](cr/java11plus.png) This option enables or disables JDK Flight Recorder (JFR) in the VM. This built-in profiling and troubleshooting feature in the VM collects profiling and diagnostic information.

:fontawesome-solid-pencil:{: .note aria-hidden="true"} **Note:** Support for JFR is currently provided as a technical preview. All JFR-related `jcmd` options might change in future releases.

## Syntax

        -XX:[+|-]FlightRecorder

| Setting                            | Effect  | Default                                                                            |
|------------------------------------|---------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| `-XX:+FlightRecorder` | Enable  | :fontawesome-solid-check:{: .yes aria-hidden="true"}<span class="sr-only">yes</span> |
| `-XX:-FlightRecorder` | Disable |               |

## Explanation

If JFR is enabled in the VM with the `-XX:+FlightRecorder` option, then you can trigger profile and diagnostic recording with the [`jcmd`](https://eclipse.dev/openj9/docs/tool_jcmd/) tool. Recording does not start automatically, it must be triggered.

To start a recording, specify the following command:

```
jcmd <vmid | display name | 0> JFR.start [filename=<file_name_with_path>] [duration=<time_with_unit_of_time>]

```
where:

- Optional parameters are shown in brackets, [ ].

- `filename=<file_name_with_path>` specifies the name of the file and its location where the recording is saved. The file name should have a `.jfr` extension. If a file name is not specified, the recording is saved in the `defaultJ9recording.jfr` file in the process working directory by default.

- `duration=<time_with_unit_of_time>` specifies the duration of the recording. Units of time are `s` (seconds), `m` (minutes), `h` (hours), and `d` (days). You can specify only one unit of time, for example, 54s, 12m, 1h, or 2d. If the duration is not specified, the tool continues to record until the recording is manually stopped or the VM is shut down.

Example:

```
jcmd 1234 JFR.start filename=/path/ABCD.jfr duration=4s

```
