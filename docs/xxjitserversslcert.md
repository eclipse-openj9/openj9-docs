# -XX:JITServerSSLCert / -XX:JITServerSSLKey / -XX:JITServerSSLRootCerts

Options for encrypting network communication between JITServer servers and JITServer client VMs.

## Syntax

        -XX:JITServerCert=<cert_file>
        -XX:JITServerKey=<key_file>
        -XX:JITServerSSLRootCerts=<root_certs_file>

The files must all be in `.pem` file format.

|`-XX:JITServerSSLRootCerts`           | Set client's SSL root certificate | None                                                                                    |

## Explanation

You can encrypt network communication by using OpenSSL 1.0.x or 1.1.x. To enable encryption, specify the private key (`<key>.pem`) and the certificate (`<cert>.pem`) at the server:

    -XX:JITServerSSLKey=<key>.pem -XX:JITServerSSLCert=<cert>.pem

and use the certificate at the client:

    -XX:JITServerSSLRootCerts=<cert>.pem

You must specify all three options for the client to be able to connect to the server. If the client cannot connect, it is forced to perform all compilations locally instead.
