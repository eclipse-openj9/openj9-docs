# -Xscdmx 

Use the `-Xscdmx` option to control the size of the class debug area when you create a shared classes cache.

## Syntax

        -Xscdmx<size>

See [Using -X command-line options](x_jvm_commands.md) for more information about the `<size>` parameter.

## Explanation

The `-Xscdmx` option works in a similar way to the [`-Xscmx`](xscmx.md) option, which is used to control the overall size of the shared classes cache. The size of `-Xscdmx` must be smaller than the size of `-Xscmx`. By default, the size of the class debug area is a percentage of the free class data bytes in a newly created or empty cache.

A class debug area is still created if you use the [`-Xnolinenumbers`](xlinenumbers.md) option with the `-Xscdmx` option on the command line.
