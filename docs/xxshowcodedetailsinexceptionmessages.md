# -XX:[+|-]ShowCodeDetailsInExceptionMessages

This OpenJDK HotSpot option enables or disables the feature that displays the details of a `NullPointerException` generated by a VM. This option is recognized by Eclipse OpenJ9&trade; and provided for compatibility.

## Syntax

        -XX:[+|-]ShowCodeDetailsInExceptionMessages

| Setting               | Effect  | Default                                                                            |

## Explanation

A `NullPointerException` might include a message if a message was specified in the `NullPointerException` constructor or a `null` message if no message was specified in the constructor. A `NullPointerException` that is generated by a VM also has a `null` message. These messages do not have details of the reason for the exceptions thrown. A `NullPointerException` also includes a stack trace that contains the method, file name, and line number where the exception occurred. However, a single line of code might contain several access paths. Each of these paths might be the source of that exception, and it is difficult to identify the path that is the root cause of the exception.

[JEP 358: Helpful NullPointerExceptions](https://openjdk.org/jeps/358) provides extended messages when a `NullPointerException` is generated by a VM. You can enable this feature with the `-XX:+ShowCodeDetailsInExceptionMessages` option, which is a part of this JEP 358. When this feature is enabled and the VM throws a `NullPointerException`, a detailed message with the action that was not completed because of this exception and the reason for this exception is displayed. For example, in the following message, `Cannot read field "c"` is the action that was not completed and `because "a.b" is null` is the root cause of the exception.

```
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot read field "c" because "a.b" is null
    at Prog.main(Prog.java:5)
```
