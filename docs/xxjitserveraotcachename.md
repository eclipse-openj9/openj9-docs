# -XX:JITServerAOTCacheName

This option, used at client JVMs, specifies the name of the AOT cache to be used at the JITServer

## Syntax

        -XX:JITServerAOTCacheName=<cache-name>

| Setting                 | Effect | Default                                                            |
|-------------------------|--------|:------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|`-XX:JITServerAOTCacheName` | Specifies the name of the server-side AOT cache to use | No name         |


## Explanation

A single JITServer instance can use multiple AOT caches that are distinguished by their name.
The idea behind this design choice is to allow clients running applications with significantly different execution profiles to connect to the same JITServer instance.
This option must be specified at the client JVM. If no such option is provided, the client will use a nameless cache.

Note that [`-XX:+JITServerUseAOTCache`](xxjitserveruseaotcache) must also be specified, otherwise the `-XX:JITServerAOTCacheName` option is ignored.
