# -XX:\[+|-\]VMLockClassLoader

This option affects synchronization on class loaders that are not parallel-capable class loaders, during class loading.

## Syntax

        -XX:[+|-]VMLockClassLoader

| Setting                  | Effect  | Default                                                                            |
|--------------------------|---------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| `-XX:+VMLockClassLoader` | Enable  | :fontawesome-solid-check:{: .yes aria-hidden="true"}<span class="sr-only">yes</span> |
| `-XX:-VMLockClassLoader` | Disable |                                                                                    |

:   The option, `-XX:+VMLockClassLoader`, causes the VM to force synchronization on a class loader that is not a parallel capable class loader during class loading. This action occurs even if the `loadClass()` method for that class loader is not synchronized. For information about parallel capable class loaders, see `java.lang.ClassLoader.registerAsParallelCapable()`. Note that this option might cause a deadlock if class loaders use non-hierarchical delegation. For example, setting the system property `osgi.classloader.lock=classname` with Equinox is known to cause a deadlock. This is the default option.

    When specifying the `-XX:-VMLockClassLoader` option, the VM does not force synchronization on a class loader during class loading. The class loader still conforms to class library synchronization, such as a synchronized `loadClass()` method.
