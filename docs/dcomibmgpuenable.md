# -Dcom.ibm.gpu.enable

:fontawesome-solid-exclamation-triangle:{: .warn aria-hidden="true"} **Restriction:** This system property is supported only on Java&trade; 11 and later

Use this system property to control the type of processing that can be offloaded to a graphics processing unit (GPU) when processing requirements meet a specific threshold. This feature can improve the performance of certain Java functions.

## Syntax

        -Dcom.ibm.gpu.enable=[all|sort]

| Setting      | Effect                                                      |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| all          | Turns on GPU processing for all possible Java functions.    |
| sort         | Turns on GPU processing only for the Java `sort()` function.|

By default, this property is not set.

## Explanation

Because establishing and completing communication with a GPU incurs an additional overhead, not all processing requirements benefit from being offloaded to the GPU. When set, this property enables GPU processing for any array that meets a minimum size.
