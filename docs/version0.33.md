## Features and changes

### Binaries and supported environments

OpenJ9 release 0.33.0 supports OpenJDK 8, 11, 17, and 18.

OpenJ9 Windows&reg; builds for OpenJDK 8 are now compiled with Microsoft&reg; Visual Studio 2017. The Visual Studio redistributable files included with the build are updated to match.

To learn more about support for OpenJ9 releases, including OpenJDK levels and platform support, see [Supported environments](openj9_support.md).

### ![Start of content that applies to Java 11](cr/java11.png) XL C++ Runtime required on AIX

AIX OpenJ9 builds now require version 16.1 of the [IBM XL C++ Runtime](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/fix-list-xl-cc-runtime-aix#161X).
This was already required for OpenJDK 17 and is now also required from 11.0.16 to accommodate a security update to the HarfBuzz text shaping library.

### ![Start of content that applies to Java 17 plus](cr/java17plus.png) Linux reference compiler updated to gcc 10.3

Linux builds for all platforms now use gcc 10.3 instead of gcc 7.5. See the list of [build environments](openj9_support.md#build-environments).

### Control groups v2 support

The Linux kernel has two variants of [control groups (cgroups): v1 and v2](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cgroups.7.html). Many Linux operating systems are gradually transitioning from cgroups v1 to v2 as their default choice. Now, OpenJ9 has added cgroups v2 support which is identical to the support for cgroups v1.

### Support for OpenSSL 3.0.x

The JITServer technology feature now supports OpenSSL 3.0.x. For more information about OpenSSL support, see [`Cryptographic operations`](introduction.md#cryptographic-operations).
