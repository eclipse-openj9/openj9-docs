# -Xcodecache

Use this option to tune performance.

This option sets the size of each block of memory that is allocated to store the native code of compiled Java&trade; methods. By default, this size is selected internally according to the processor architecture and the capability of your system. The maximum value you can specify is 32 MB. If you set a value larger than 32 MB, the JIT ignores the input and sets the value to 32 MB.

:fontawesome-solid-pencil-alt:{: .note aria-hidden="true"} **Note:** The JIT compiler might allocate more than one code cache for an application. Use the [`-Xcodecachetotal`](xcodecachetotal.md) option to set the maximum amount of memory that is used by all code caches.


## Syntax

        -Xcodecache<size>

: See [Using -X command-line options](x_jvm_commands.md) for more information about specifying the `<size>` parameter.
