# -XX:OnOutOfMemoryError

You can use this Oracle HotSpot option to run commands when a `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError` is thrown. This option is recognized by OpenJ9 and provided for compatibility.

## Syntax

        -XX:OnOutOfMemoryError="<command_string>"

where `<command_string>` is a command or list of commands to run when a `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError` occurs.

For example, the following command specifies that the `java -version` command is run if the `Test` application throws a `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError` exception:

`java -XX:OnOutOfMemoryError="java -version" Test`

If you want to run multiple commands, use semicolons to separate them  within `<command_string>`. For example:

`-XX:OnOutOfMemoryError="<java_path> <java_program>; cat file.txt"`

The `-XX:OnOutOfMemoryError` option is equivalent to the following `-Xdump` option:

`-Xdump:tool:events=systhrow,filter=java/lang/OutOfMemoryError,exec=<command_string>`

For more information, see [`-Xdump`](xdump.md).
