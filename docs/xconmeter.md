# -Xconmeter 

This option determines the usage of which area, LOA (large object area) or SOA (small object area), is metered and hence which allocations are taxed during concurrent mark.

## Syntax

        -Xconmeter:<parameter>

## Parameters

### `soa`

        -Xconmeter:soa

: (Default) Applies the allocation tax to allocations from the small object area (SOA).

### `loa`

        -Xconmeter:loa

: Applies the allocation tax to allocations from the large object area (LOA).

### `dynamic`

        -Xconmeter:dynamic

: The collector dynamically determines which area to meter based on which area is exhausted first, whether it is the SOA or the LOA.

## Default behavior

By default, allocation tax is applied to the SOA.
