# -XXnosuballoc32bitmem  

**(z/OS&reg; only)**

When compressed references are used with a 64-bit OpenJ9 VM on z/OS&reg;, this option forces the VM to use 31-bit memory allocation functions provided by z/OS.

## Syntax

        -XXnosuballoc32bitmem

| Setting                 | Effect  | Default                                                                            |
|-------------------------|---------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| `-XXnosuballoc32bitmem` | Enable  |                                                                                    |   
| No setting              | Disable | :fontawesome-solid-check:{: .yes aria-hidden="true"}<span class="sr-only">yes</span> |

## Explanation

This option is provided as a workaround for customers who need to use fewer pages of 31-bit virtual storage per VM invocation. Using this option might result in a small increase in the number of frames of central storage used by the VM. However, the option frees 31-bit pages for use by native code or other applications in the same address space.

If this option is not specified, the VM uses an allocation strategy for 31-bit memory that reserves a region of 31-bit virtual memory.
