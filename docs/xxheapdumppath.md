# -XX:HeapDumpPath

This HotSpot option is recognized by OpenJ9 for compatibility, and you can use it as an alias for [`-Xdump:directory=<path>`](xdump.md#syntax).

This option sets the directory for all VM dumps including heap dumps, Java&trade; dumps, and system dumps.

## Syntax

        -XX:HeapDumpPath=<path>

where `<path>` is the directory to which all dump types are written. This directory path is prefixed to the path of all non-absolute dump file names, including the file names for the default dump agents.
