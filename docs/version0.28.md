# What's new in version 0.28.0

The following new features and notable changes since v 0.27.0 are included in this release:

- [New binaries and changes to supported environments](#binaries-and-supported-environments)
- [Next item](#next-item)


## Features and changes

### Binaries and supported environments

OpenJ9 release 0.28.0 supports OpenJDK 17. OpenJDK 17 with Eclipse OpenJ9 is *not* a long term support (LTS) release.

Although it might be possible to build an OpenJDK 8 or OpenJDK 11 with OpenJ9 release 0.28.0, testing at the project is not complete and therefore support for new features that apply to these Java versions is not available.

To learn more about support for OpenJ9 releases, including OpenJDK levels and platform support, see [Supported environments](openj9_support.md).

### Next item ###
<!-- Replace this with the next new feature for 0.28 and update the URL list near the top of the topic to point to this section -->

## Full release information

To see a complete list of changes between Eclipse OpenJ9 v0.27.0 and v0.28.0 releases, see the [Release notes](https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9/blob/master/doc/release-notes/0.28/0.28.md).
