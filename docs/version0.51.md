## Features and changes

### Binaries and supported environments

Eclipse OpenJ9&trade; release 0.51.0 supports OpenJDK 8, 11, 17, and 21.

Ubuntu 20.04 is removed from the list of supported platforms.

To learn more about support for OpenJ9 releases, including OpenJDK levels and platform support, see [Supported environments](openj9_support.md).

### New parameter `maxstringlength` added to the `-Xtrace` option

You can use the `maxstringlength` parameter of the `-Xtrace` option to specify the length of the string arguments and return values of a method that are now printed in a trace output in addition to the addresses.

For more information, see [`maxstringlength`](xtrace.md#maxstringlength).

### XL C++ Runtime 16.1.0.10 or later required for AIX OpenJ9 builds

AIX OpenJ9 builds now require version 16.1.0.10 or later of the [IBM XL C++ Runtime](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/fix-list-xl-cc-runtime-aix#161X).

### ![Start of content that applies to Java 11 (LTS) and later](cr/java11plus.png) Support for JDK Flight Recorder (JFR) in the VM for OpenJDK 11 and later running on all platforms

This release now supports JFR in the VM as a technical preview for OpenJDK 11 and later running on all platforms. In the 0.49.0 release, the support for JFR was available on OpenJDK 11 and later running on Linux&reg; x86 and Linux on AArch64 only.  ![End of content that applies only to Java 11 and later](cr/java_close.png)
