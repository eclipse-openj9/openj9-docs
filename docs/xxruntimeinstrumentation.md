# -XX:\[+|-\]RuntimeInstrumentation  

**(AIX&reg;, Linux&reg;, and z/OS&reg; only)**

This option controls the use of the Runtime Instrumentation (RI) facility in the virtual machines that support it.

The RI facility is a feature that is available in POWER8&reg;, zEC12, and later processors that offers hardware support for collecting profiling information at run time. The process uses minimal resources. The use of the RI facility is not enabled by default.

## Syntax

        -XX:[+|-]RuntimeInstrumentation

| Setting                       | Effect  | Default                                                                            |
|-------------------------------|---------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| `-XX:+RuntimeInstrumentation` | Enable  |                                                                                    |
| `-XX:-RuntimeInstrumentation` | Disable |  <i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="sr-only">yes</span>|


<i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Note:** On Linux, the RI facility on Power 8 and later processors uses the Performance Monitoring Unit (PMU) inside the processor. However, the PMU is also used by system profilers like **oprofile** or **perf**. Due to the current Linux kernel implementation, a user cannot reliably profile a Java&trade; application when RI is enabled. Although this limitation might be addressed in future Linux kernels, for reliable profiling on Power systems that use Linux, the `-XX:-RuntimeInstrumentation` option must be used.
