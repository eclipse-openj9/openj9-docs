# What's new in version 0.10.0

The following new features and notable changes since v.0.9.0 are included in this release:

- [New binaries and changes to supported environments.](#binaries-and-supported-environments)
- [Change to the default shared classes cache size for OpenJDK 8 builds](#change-to-the-default-shared-classes-cache-size)
- [New information for the SHARED CLASSES section of a Javadump file](#new-information-for-the-shared-classes-section-of-a-java-dump-file)
- [Support for OpenJDK HotSpot options](#support-for-openjdk-hotspot-options)

## Features and changes

### Binaries and supported environments

OpenJ9 release 0.10.0 supports OpenJDK 11, which is available from the AdoptOpenJDK community at the following link:

- [OpenJDK version 11](https://adoptopenjdk.net/archive.html?variant=openjdk11&jvmVariant=openj9)

OpenJDK 11 with Eclipse OpenJ9 is a long term support (LTS) release and supersedes OpenJDK 10 with Eclipse OpenJ9.

Although it is possible to build an OpenJDK v8 with the OpenJ9 0.10.0 release level, testing at the project is not complete and therefore support is not available.

To learn more about support for OpenJ9 releases, including OpenJDK levels and platform support, see [Supported environments](openj9_support.md)

### Change to the default shared classes cache size

For OpenJDK 8 builds, the default shared classes cache size is increased from 16 MB to 300 MB, with a "soft" maximum limit for the initial size of the cache set to 64 MB. Certain exceptions apply. For more information, see [-Xshareclasses](xshareclasses.md). The new default also applies to OpenJDK 11 builds.

### New information for the SHARED CLASSES section of a Java dump file

The value of the soft maximum size (`-Xscmx`) of the shared classes cache is now recorded in the `SHARED CLASSES` section of a Java dump file against the string `2SCLTEXTSMB`. For example output, see [Java dump](dump_javadump.md).

### Support for OpenJDK HotSpot options

For compatibility, the following OpenJDK HotSpot options are now supported by OpenJ9:

- [-XX:HeapDumpPath](xxheapdumppath.md)
- [-XX:\[+|-\]HeapDumpOnOutOfMemory](xxheapdumponoutofmemory.md)
- [-XX:ActiveProcessorCount](xxactiveprocessorcount.md)
