# -Xverbosegclog

Causes garbage collection (GC) output from the `-verbose:gc` option to be written to a specified file.

## Syntax

        -Xverbosegclog[:<filename>[,<x>,<y>]]

: where `<filename>` is the name of the file to which output is written. Dump agent tokens can be used in the filename.

    If the file cannot be found, the file is created, and output is written to the new file.

    If the file cannot be created (for example, if an invalid filename is specified), output is redirected to `stderr`.

    If you do not specify a file name, `verbosegc.%Y%m%d.%H%M%S.%pid.txt` is used (for example, `verbosegc.20180124.093210.1234.txt`).

    If you specify `<x>` and `<y>`, output is redirected to `x` files, each containing `y` GC cycles.

## Default behavior

By default, no verbose GC logging occurs.
