# -XX:\[+|-\]ReadIPInfoForRAS


Use this command-line option to enable and disable network queries from being used to determine the host name and IP address for RAS (reliability, availability, and serviceability) troubleshooting purposes.

## Syntax

        -XX:[+|-]ReadIPInfoForRAS

| Setting                 | Effect  | Default                                                                            |
|-------------------------|---------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| `-XX:+ReadIPInfoForRAS` | Enable  | <i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="sr-only">yes</span>     |
| `-XX:-ReadIPInfoForRAS` | Disable |                                                                                    |

OpenJ9 captures the host name and IP address by default, for use in diagnosing problems. But if a nameserver cannot be contacted when a network query is made, the program will wait until the resolver times out.

You can avoid this situation by using the `-XX:-ReadIPInfoForRAS` command-line option to prevent the query from being performed.
