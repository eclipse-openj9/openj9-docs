# What's new in version 0.26.0

The following new features and notable changes since version 0.25.0 are included in this release:

- [New binaries and changes to supported environments](#binaries-and-supported-environments)
- [Dump extractor tool deprecated](#dump-extractor-tool-deprecated)


## Features and changes

### Binaries and supported environments

OpenJ9 release 0.26.0 supports OpenJDK 8, 11, and 16.

For OpenJDK 8 and 11 builds that contain OpenJ9, see [Version 0.25.0](version0.25.md) for additional changes that have now been fully tested for these versions.

To learn more about support for OpenJ9 releases, including OpenJDK levels and platform support, see [Supported environments](openj9_support.md).

### Dump extractor tool deprecated

The dump extractor tool, `jextract`, is deprecated in this release and replaced with the `jpackcore` tool. This tool uses the same syntax and parameters as `jextract` to collect diagnostic files for analysis. The change is necessary because the reference implementation will be introducing a tool in a future release that is also called `jextract`.

For more information, see [Dump extractor](tool_jextract.md).


## Full release information

To see a complete list of changes between Eclipse OpenJ9 v0.25.0 and v0.26.0 releases, see the [Release notes](https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9/blob/master/doc/release-notes/0.26/0.26.md).
