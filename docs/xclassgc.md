# -Xclassgc / -Xnoclassgc

Enables and disables the garbage collection (GC) of storage that is associated with Java classes that are no longer being used by the OpenJ9 VM.

When enabled, GC occurs only on class loader changes. To always enable dynamic class unloading regardless of class loader changes, set [`-Xalwaysclassgc`](xalwaysclassgc.md).

:fontawesome-solid-pencil-alt:{: .note aria-hidden="true"} **Note:** Disabling class GC is not recommended because unlimited native memory growth can occur, which can lead to out-of-memory errors.

## Syntax

| Setting      | Action     | Default                                                                            |
|--------------|------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|`-Xclassgc`   | Enables dynamic class unloading on demand  | :fontawesome-solid-check:{: .yes aria-hidden="true"}<span class="sr-only">yes</span> |
|`-Xnoclassgc` | Disables dynamic class unloading |                                                                                    |

These options can be used with all OpenJ9 GC policies.
