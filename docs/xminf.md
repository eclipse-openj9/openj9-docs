# `-Xminf` / `-Xmaxf`


Specifies the minimum and maximum proportion of the heap that must remain free after a global garbage collection (GC) cycle.

If the free space is above or below these limits, the OpenJ9 VM attempts to adjust the heap size so that: `-Xminf` &le; free space &le; `-Xmaxf`.

## Syntax

| Setting        | Effect                 | Default |
|----------------|------------------------|---------|
|`-Xminf<value>` | Set minimum free space | 0.3     |
|`-Xmaxf<value>` | Set maximum free space | 0.6     |

The value range is 0.0 - 1.0.

- For the `gencon` GC policy, the values apply only to the Tenure part of the heap and only at global GC points.
- For the `optthruput` and `optavgpause` GC policies, these values apply to the whole heap at every GC point.
