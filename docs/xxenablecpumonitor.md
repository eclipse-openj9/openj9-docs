# -XX:\[+|-\]EnableCPUMonitor

This option relates to the information about the CPU usage of thread categories that is available with the `com.ibm.lang.management.JvmCpuMonitorMXBean` application programming interface.

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Restriction:** This option might not be supported in subsequent releases.

## Syntax

        -XX:[+|-]EnableCPUMonitor

| Setting                 | Effect  | Default                                                                            |
|-------------------------|---------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| `-XX:+EnableCPUMonitor` | Enable  | <i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="sr-only">yes</span> |
| `-XX:-EnableCPUMonitor` | Disable |                                                                                    |

## Explanation

The `-XX:+EnableCPUMonitor` option enables CPU monitoring, which allows a JMX bean to track CPU usage on a per thread basis and attributes the usage against different categories. For more information, see the `JvmCpuMonitorMXBean` interface in the `com.ibm.lang.management` API documentation.

To turn off CPU monitoring, set the `-XX:-EnableCPUMonitor` option on the command line.
