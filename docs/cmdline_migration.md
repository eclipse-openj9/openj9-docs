# Switching to OpenJ9

If you are already familiar with HotSpot command-line options but want the advantages of OpenJ9, the following information will prove helpful. In all cases, check individual topics for minor discrepancies in the way these options might work.

<i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Note:** For information about HotSpot equivalences and differences for items other than command-line options, see [New to OpenJ9?](openj9_newuser.md).

## Compatible options

You can use the following command-line options in OpenJ9, just as you did in Hotspot; you can continue to use the HotSpot option in OpenJ9 without having to change your code:

## Equivalent options

These Hotspot command-line options have equivalents in OpenJ9 that are not specified in the same way, but perform a related function:

| HotSpot Option          | OpenJ9 Option                                    | Usage                                                            |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|                                                                        
| `-Xcomp`                | [`-Xjit:count=0`](xjit.md#count)**<sup>1</sup>** | `-Xcomp` disables interpreted method invocations.                |
| `-Xgc`                  | [`-Xgcpolicy`](xgcpolicy.md)**<sup>2</sup>**     | Configuring your garbage collection policy.                      |
| `-XX:ParallelGCThreads` | [`-Xgcthreads`](xgcthreads.md)                   | Configure number of GC threads.                                  |
| `-XX:+UseNUMA`          | [`-Xnuma:none`](xnumanone.md)**<sup>3</sup>**    | Controls non-uniform memory architecture (NUMA) awareness.       |

<i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Notes:**

1. Hotspot uses `-Xcomp` to force compilation of methods on first invocation. However, this option is deprecated. Whilst it can be used for compatibility, using `-Xjit:count=0` is preferred.

2. Hotspot uses `-Xgc` to both select policies and configure them; OpenJ9 uses `-Xgcpolicy` to select policies, reserving `-Xgc` for configuration.

3. In Hotspot, NUMA awareness is turned off by default and is turned on by using the `-XX:+UseNUMA` option. Conversely, the OpenJ9 VM automatically enables NUMA awareness and uses `-Xnuma:none` to turn it *off*.
    - If you were previously using Hotspot in its default mode, you must now explicitly turn off NUMA awareness in OpenJ9.
    - If you are used to using `-XX:+UseNUMA` in Hotspot, you no longer need to explicitly turn on NUMA awareness; it's on by default.
