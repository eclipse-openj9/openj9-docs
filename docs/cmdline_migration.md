# Switching to OpenJ9

If you are already familiar with HotSpot command-line options but want the advantages of OpenJ9, the following information will prove helpful. In all cases, check individual topics for minor discrepancies in the way these options might work.

<i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Note:** For information about HotSpot equivalences and differences for items other than command-line options, see [New to OpenJ9?](openj9_newuser.md)

## Compatible options

You can use the following command-line options in OpenJ9, just as you did in HotSpot; you can continue to use the HotSpot option in OpenJ9 without having to change your code:

| Option                                                           | Usage                                                                                                                                        |

## Equivalent options

These HotSpot command-line options have equivalents in OpenJ9 that are not specified in the same way, but perform a related function:

| HotSpot Option          | OpenJ9 Option                                    | Usage                                                     |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|                                                                        
| `-Xcomp`                | [`-Xjit:count=0`](xjit.md#count)**<sup>1</sup>** | `-Xcomp` disables interpreted method invocations.         |
| `-Xgc`                  | [`-Xgcpolicy`](xgcpolicy.md)**<sup>2</sup>**     | Configuring your garbage collection policy.               |
| `-XX:+UseNUMA`          | [`-Xnuma:none`](xnumanone.md)**<sup>3</sup>**    | Controls non-uniform memory architecture (NUMA) awareness.|

<i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Notes:**

1. HotSpot uses `-Xcomp` to force compilation of methods on first invocation. However, this option is deprecated. Whilst it can be used for compatibility, using `-Xjit:count=0` is preferred.

2. HotSpot uses `-Xgc` to both select policies and configure them; OpenJ9 uses `-Xgcpolicy` to select policies, reserving `-Xgc` for configuration.

3. In HotSpot, NUMA awareness is turned off by default and is turned on by using the `-XX:+UseNUMA` option. Conversely, the OpenJ9 VM automatically enables NUMA awareness and uses `-Xnuma:none` to turn it *off*.
    - If you were previously using HotSpot in its default mode, you must now explicitly turn off NUMA awareness in OpenJ9.
    - If you are used to using `-XX:+UseNUMA` in HotSpot, you no longer need to explicitly turn on NUMA awareness; it's on by default.


## Creating compatible behavior

You can set the following options to make OpenJ9 behave in the same way as HotSpot.

| Option                                                           | Usage                                                                                                                                        |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![Start of content that applies only to Java 8 (LTS)](cr/java8.png) [`-Djava.lang.string.substring.nocopy=true`](djavalangstringsubstringnocopy.md) |  Avoid String sharing by String.substring(). ![End of content that applies only to Java 8](cr/java_close_lts.png) |
| [`-Xnuma:none`](xnumanone.md)                                                     | Disable non-uniform memory architecture (NUMA) awareness.       |
| [`-XXHandleSIGABRT`](xxhandlesigabrt.md) | Force handling of SIGABRT signals to be compatible with HotSpot |


## Compatible environment variables

The `JAVA_OPTIONS` and `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` environment variables can be used to set command line options as described in [OpenJ9 command-line options](cmdline_specifying.md) and [Environment variables](env_var.md).
