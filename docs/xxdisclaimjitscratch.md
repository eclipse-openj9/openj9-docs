# -XX:\[+|-\]DisclaimJitScratch  

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Restriction:** This option is deprecated; the option is accepted but ignored.

**(Linux&reg; only)**

The `-XX:+DisclaimJitScratch` option signals to the operating system to discard temporary physical memory that is consumed by the JIT compilation threads.

## Syntax

        -XX:[+|-]DisclaimJitScratch

| Setting                 | Effect | Default                                                                            |
|-------------------------|--------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|`-XX:+DisclaimJitScratch`| Enable |                                                                                    |
|`-XX:-DisclaimJitScratch`| Disable| <i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="sr-only">yes</span> |

## Explanation

Discarding temporary physical memory can reduce the physical memory reported in use by the Java&trade; application. The physical memory that is released is available to other processes without the operating system needing to search for the least recently used frames.

The `-XX:-DisclaimJitScratch` option turns off a previously enabled `-XX:+DisclaimJitScratch` option.
