# -Xnuma:none

**(AIX&reg;, Linux&reg;, and Windows&trade; only)**

Use this option to turn off non-uniform memory architecture (NUMA) awareness when using the balanced garbage collection policy.

For workloads that do most of their work in one thread, or workloads that maintain a full heap, turning off NUMA awareness can improve performance.

## Syntax

        -Xnuma:none

## Default behavior

NUMA awareness is enabled by default.
