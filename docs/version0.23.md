# What's new in version 0.23.0

The following new features and notable changes since v 0.22.0 are included in this release:

- [New binaries and changes to supported environments](#binaries-and-supported-environments)
- [`-XX:[+|-]PortableSharedCache` option behavior update](#-xx-portablesharedcache-option-behavior-update)
- [`-XX:[+|-]IdleTuningCompactOnIdle` option now inactive](#-xx-idletuningcompactonidle-option-now-inactive)
- [Support for OpenJDK HotSpot options](#support-for-openjdk-hotspot-options)
- [Extended platform support for the JITServer technology preview](#extended-platform-support-for-the-jitserver-technology-preview)


## Features and changes

### Binaries and supported environments

OpenJ9 release 0.23.0 supports OpenJDK 8, 11, and 15. Binaries are available from the AdoptOpenJDK community at the following links:

- [OpenJDK version 8](https://adoptopenjdk.net/archive.html?variant=openjdk8&jvmVariant=openj9)
- [OpenJDK version 11](https://adoptopenjdk.net/archive.html?variant=openjdk11&jvmVariant=openj9)
- [OpenJDK version 15](https://adoptopenjdk.net/archive.html?variant=openjdk15&jvmVariant=openj9)

To learn more about support for OpenJ9 releases, including OpenJDK levels and platform support, see [Supported environments](openj9_support.md).

### `-XX:[+|-]PortableSharedCache` option behavior update

The `-XX:[+|-]PortableSharedCache` option is updated to improve the portability of AOT-compiled code further. This update allows AOT-compiled code to be portable across OpenJ9 VMs that use compressed references and have a heap size of 1 MB to 28 GB when this option is enabled. This option might introduce a small (1-2%) steady-state throughput penalty when compressed references are used and the heap size is between 1 MB and 3 GB. See [`-XX:[+|-]PortableSharedCache`](xxportablesharedcache.md) for more details about this option.

### `-XX:[+|-]IdleTuningCompactOnIdle` option now inactive

Setting the `-XX:[+|-]IdleTuningCompactOnIdle` option now has no effect. A compaction is triggered by internal heuristics that look into the number of fragmented pages. Typically there is no need to force a compaction. This option was deprecated in release 0.15.0, and will be removed in the future. See [`-XX:[+|-]IdleTuningCompactOnIdle`](xxidletuningcompactonidle.md) for details about this option.

### Support for OpenJDK HotSpot options

For compatibility, the following OpenJDK HotSpot options are now supported by OpenJ9:

- [`-XX:[+|-]AlwaysPreTouch`](xxalwayspretouch.md)

### Extended platform support for the JITServer technology preview

Platform support for the JITServer technology preview is now extended to 64-bit Linux&reg; on IBM Power&reg; systems, and 64-bit Linux on IBM Z&reg; systems. JITServer decouples the JIT compiler from the OpenJ9 VM, freeing up CPU and memory for an application. JITServer runs in its own process, either locally or on a remote machine, where resources can be separately managed. This preview was initially introduced in Eclipse OpenJ9 V0.18.1 for Linux on 64-bit x86 systems. For more information, see [JITServer technology (technical preview)](jitserver.md).
