# Standard command-line options


The OpenJ9 virtual machine supports the standard Java&trade; options that are common to all Java virtual machine implementations, including Oracle's HotSpot VM.
Some of the common options supported are summarised in the following table:

| Standard option name                                                | Purpose                                                                                                                   |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-classpath:<resource_name>[:<resource_name>]`                      | Sets the search path for application classes and resources (directories and compressed or .jar files). `cp` can be used instead of `classpath`.|
| `-help`, `-?`                                                       | Prints a usage message.                                                                                                   |
| `-fullversion`                                                      | Prints the build and version information for a VM                                                                         |
| `-showversion`                                                      | Prints product version and continues.                                                                                     |
| `-verbose:<option>[,<option>]`                                      | Enables verbose output. Options include `class`, `dynload`, `gc`, `init`, `jni`, `sizes`, `stack`, and `module`. (See **Notes**)     |
| `-version`                                                          | Prints the full build and version information a VM                                                                        |

:fontawesome-solid-pencil-alt:{: .note aria-hidden="true"} **Notes:**

- `-verbose:class`: Writes an entry to `stderr` for each class that is loaded.
- `-verbose:dynload`: Writes detailed class information to `stderr` as each bootstrap class is loaded by the VM:
- `-verbose:gc`: Provides verbose garbage collection information.
- `-verbose:init`: Writes information to `stderr` describing VM initialization and termination.
- `-verbose:jni`: Writes information to `stderr` describing the JNI services called by the application and VM.
- `-verbose:sizes`: Writes information to `stderr` describing the active memory usage settings.
- `-verbose:stack`: Writes information to `stderr` describing the Java and C stack usage for each thread.
- `-verbose:module`: ![Start of content that applies to Java 11 (LTS) and later](cr/java11plus.png) Writes information to `stderr` for each module that is loaded and unloaded.

## OpenJ9 extensions

OpenJ9 supports the following extension to the `-verbose` option:

- `-verbose:stacktrace` : Writes either the module name or the `Classloader` name (with the code source location when available) to the end of each line of a Java stack trace.
