# -XX:-StackTraceInThrowable


This option removes stack traces from exceptions.

## Syntax

        -XX:-StackTraceInThrowable

| Setting                      | Effect  | Default                                                          |
|------------------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`-XX:-StackTraceInThrowable`  | Disable | No                                                               |

:   While stack traces are included in exceptions by default, recording them can have a negative impact on performance. Use this option if you want to remove stack traces, although this might cause difficulties with problem determination.

    When this option is enabled, `Throwable.getStackTrace()` returns an empty array and the stack trace is displayed when an uncaught exception occurs. `Thread.getStackTrace()` and `Thread.getAllStackTraces()` are not affected by this option.
