# Trace formatter (`traceformat`)


The trace formatter is a Java&trade; program that converts binary trace point data in a trace file to a readable form. The formatter requires the `TraceFormat.dat` and `J9TraceFormat.dat` files, which contain the formatting templates. The formatter produces a file that contains header information about the VM that produced the binary trace file, a list of threads for which trace points were produced, and the formatted trace points with their time stamp, thread ID, trace point ID, and trace point data.

## Syntax

To use the trace formatter on a binary trace file type:

        traceformat <input_file>  [<output_file>] <parameters>

Where `<input_file>` is the name of the binary trace file to be formatted, and `<output_file>` is the name of the output file. If you do not specify an output file, the output file is called `input_file.fmt`.

The size of the heap that is needed to format the trace is directly proportional to the number of threads present in the trace file. For large numbers of threads the formatter might run out of memory, generating the error `OutOfMemoryError`. In this case, increase the heap size by using the `-Xmx` option.

## Parameters

The following `<parameters>` are available with the trace formatter:

|  Option                                  | Explanation                                                                                                               |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-datfile=<file1.dat>[,<file2.dat>]`     | A comma-separated list of trace formatting data files. By default, the following files are used:$JAVA_HOME/lib/J9TraceFormat.dat and $JAVA_HOME/lib/TraceFormat.dat |
| `-format_time=yes|no`                    | Specifies whether to format the time stamps into human readable form. The default is `yes`.                               |
| `-help`                                  | Displays usage information.                                                                                               |
| `-indent`                                | Indents trace messages at each `Entry` trace point and outdents trace messages at each `Exit` trace point. The default is not to indent the messages. |
| `-summary`                               | Prints summary information to the screen without generating an output file.                                               |
| `-threads=<thread id>[,<thread id>]...`  | Filters the output for the given thread IDs only. thread id is the ID of the thread, which can be specified in decimal or hex (0x) format. Any number of thread IDs can be specified, separated by commas. |
| `-timezone=+|-HH:MM`                     | Specifies the offset from UTC, as positive or negative hours and minutes, to apply when formatting time stamps.           |
| `-verbose`                               | Output detailed warning and error messages, and performance statistics.                                                   |

## Examples

The following example shows output from running the trace formatter command:

```
    C:\test>traceformat sample.trc
    Writing formatted trace output to file sample.trc.fmt
    Processing 0.4921875Mb of binary trace data
    Completed processing of 6983 tracepoints with 0 warnings and 0 errors
```

The formatted trace output looks similar to the following extract, which is truncated to show the key areas of information:
