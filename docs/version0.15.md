## Features and changes

### Binaries and supported environments

 OpenJ9 release 0.15.0 supports OpenJDK 8, 11, and 12.

 <!--Binaries are available from the AdoptOpenJDK community at the following links:
 - [OpenJDK version 8](https://adoptopenjdk.net/archive.html?variant=openjdk8&jvmVariant=openj9)
- [OpenJDK version 11](https://adoptopenjdk.net/archive.html?variant=openjdk11&jvmVariant=openj9)
- [OpenJDK version 12](https://adoptopenjdk.net/archive.html?variant=openjdk12&jvmVariant=openj9)-->

 To learn more about support for OpenJ9 releases, including OpenJDK levels and platform support, see [Supported environments](openj9_support.md).

### Performance improvements for JVMTI watched fields

 OpenJ9 version 0.14.0 introduced the [`-XX:[+|-]JITInlineWatches`](xxjitinlinewatches.md) option, which, when enabled, turned on experimental JIT operations to improve the performance of JVMTI watched fields. Following successful results, this option is now enabled by default. Currently, performance improvements are enabled only on x86 platforms (Windows&reg;, macOS&reg;, and Linux).

### Support for pause-less garbage collection on IBM Z systems

Support for Concurrent scavenge mode is now extended to Linux on IBM Z&reg; systems and z/OS&reg;. For more information, see [`-Xgc:concurrentScavenge`](xgc.md#concurrentscavenge).

### ![Start of content that applies only to Java 11 (LTS)](cr/java11.png) ChaCha20 algorithm support for OpenSSL

The ChaCha20 and ChaCha20-Poly1305 algorithms can now use OpenSSL on Java 11. For more information, see [`-Djdk.nativeChaCha20`](djdknativechacha20.md). ![End of content that applies only to Java 11 (LTS)](cr/java_close_lts.png)

### Support for OpenJDK HotSpot options

For compatibility, the [`-XX:OnOutOfMemoryError`](xxonoutofmemoryerror.md) OpenJDK Hotspot option is now supported by OpenJ9.

### Heuristics for compaction during idle GC

OpenJ9 now compacts the heap when certain triggers are met during idle GC. As a consequence of this, [`-XX:IdleTuningCompactOnIdle`](xxidletuningcompactonidle.md) has been deprecated.
