# -Xlog

This option is supported for better compatibility with the reference implementation. However, only forms of `-Xlog` that enable garbage collection (GC) logging are recognized. Note that the behavior of this option changed in Eclipse OpenJ9 0.24.0.

## Syntax

        -Xlog[:<parameters>]

:fontawesome-solid-pencil-alt:{: .note aria-hidden="true"}**Note:** In Eclipse OpenJ9 version 0.24.0, the [`-Xsyslog`](xsyslog.md) option replaced the existing OpenJ9 `-Xlog` option for message logging to avoid conflicts with the reference implementation. For backward compatibility, you can control the behavior of the `-Xlog` option with the [`-XX:[+|-]LegacyXlogOption`](xxlegacyxlogoption.md) option.


## Explanation

Use of the `-Xlog` option is supported for GC logging only. The following table describes the behavior of the option depending on what you specify on the command line.

| `-Xlog` option type         | Behavior                                    |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| An option that returns GC data. For example `-Xlog:gc`                | An equivalent OpenJ9 GC logging option is enabled. See the next table for more details. |
| An option that, in the reference implementation, returns GC data and also other data. For example: `-Xlog`, `-Xlog:all`, `-Xlog:gc+<other_tag>`, or  `-Xlog:gc:stdout` | An equivalent OpenJ9 GC logging option is enabled as before but because non-GC data is not supported, the following error message is also produced: <br/> `JVMJ9VM007W Command-line option unrecognised: <option>`      |
| An option that, in the reference implementation, returns only non-GC data            | Non-GC data is not supported, so the following error message is produced: <br/> `JVMJ9VM007W Command-line option unrecognised: <option>` |   

The following table shows some examples of the mapping between `-Xlog` parameters and the equivalent OpenJ9 GC parameters:

| `-Xlog` parameter         | OpenJ9 GC equivalent                                 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `-Xlog:gc` <br/> `-Xlog:gc:stderr`                | `-verbose:gc` |
| `-Xlog:gc:<filename>` <br/> `-Xlog:gc:file=<filename>` | `-Xverbosegclog:<updated_filename>`      |


In the table, the value of `<filename>` can contain the following tokens, which are processed and passed to the `-Xverbosegclog` option as `<updated_filename>`:

- `%p` is replaced with the process ID (equivalent to [dump agent token `%pid`](xdump.md#dump-agent-tokens))
- `%t` is replaced with the dump agent tokens `%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S`.
