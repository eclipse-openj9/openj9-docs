# -Xargencoding 

The `java` and `javaw` launchers accept arguments and class names containing any character that is in the character set of the current locale. You can also specify any Unicode character in the class name and arguments by using Java&trade; escape sequences.

To do this, use the `-Xargencoding` command-line option.

## Syntax

        -Xargencoding:<parameter>

## Parameters

### No parameter

        -Xargencoding

: You can use Unicode escape sequences in the argument list that you pass to this option. To specify a Unicode character, use escape sequences in the form `\u####`, where `#` is a hexadecimal digit (0-9, A-F). For example, to specify a class that is called `HelloWorld` and use Unicode encoding for both capital letters, use this command:

        java -Xargencoding \u0048ello\u0057orld

### `utf8`

        -Xargencoding:utf8

: Use utf8 encoding.

### `latin`

        -Xargencoding:latin

: Use ISO8859_1 encoding.
