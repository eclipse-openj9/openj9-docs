# -XX:\[+|-\]JITServerLocalSyncCompiles

When you specify this JITServer option, synchronous JIT compilations are downgraded to `cold` optimization level and compiled locally, with a remote asynchronous recompilation scheduled at a later point.

## Syntax

        -XX:[+|-]JITServerLocalSyncCompiles

| Setting                 | Effect | Default                                                                            |
|-------------------------|--------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|`-XX:+JITServerLocalSyncCompiles`           | Enable |                                                                                    |
|`-XX:-JITServerLocalSyncCompiles`           | Disable| :fontawesome-solid-check:{: .yes aria-hidden="true"}<span class="sr-only">yes</span> |

## Explanation

During a synchronous compilation, Java&trade; application threads have to wait for the compilation to complete.
Because remote compilations usually take longer, due to network latency, remote synchronous compilations can result in large pauses in the client application.

If you enable this option, the client performs synchronous compilations locally at `cold` optimization level and later recompiles asynchronously at a higher level remotely. This behavior can be beneficial for real-time applications.
