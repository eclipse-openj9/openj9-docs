# Class Data Sharing

Sharing class data between JVMs improves start up performance and reduces memory footprint.

Start up performance is improved by placing classes that an application needs when initializing into a shared classes cache. The next time the
application runs, it takes much less time to start because the classes are already available. When you enable class data sharing, AOT compilation is also enabled by default, which dynamically compiles certain methods into AOT code at runtime. By using these features in combination, startup performance can be improved even further because the cached AOT code can be used to quickly enable native code performance for subsequent runs of your application.

When class data sharing is enabled, OpenJ9 automatically creates a memory mapped file that stores and shares the classes in memory.

The shared classes cache is updated dynamically; When an application loads new classes, the JVM automatically stores them in the cache without any user intervention.

Memory footprint is reduced by sharing common classes between applications that run in separate Java VMs.

## Enabling class data sharing

![Start of content that applies only to Java 8 (LTS)](cr/java8.png)
Class data sharing is enabled by setting the `-Xshareclasses` option on the command line when you start your application. By default, OpenJ9 always shares both the bootstrap and application classes that are loaded by the default system class loader.![End of content that applies only to Java 8 (LTS)](cr/java_close_lts.png)

![Start of content that applies only to Java 11 (LTS)](cr/java11.png)  For operating systems other than macOS, which follows the Java 8 behavior, class data sharing is enabled by default for bootstrap classes only, unless your application is running in a container. You can use the `-Xshareclasses` option to change the default behavior, including the name and location of the default shared classes cache. Trace point `j9shr.2271` is activated if the default cache cannot be started, so you can enable this trace point to determine whether the default cache started successfully. You can treat the default cache like any other shared classes cache, for example you can print statistics for it, change the soft maximum limit size, or delete it. Note that if you have multiple VMs and you do not change the default shared classes behavior, the following applies:

- If the VMs are from a single Java installation, they will share a single default cache.
- If the VMs are from different Java installations, of the same Java release and installed by the same user, each VM checks whether the existing default shared cache in the cache directory is from the same Java installation as the VM. If not, the VM deletes that shared cache, then creates a new one. To avoid this situation, use `-Xshareclasses:cacheDir=<dir>` to specify a different cache directory for each Java installation. ![End of content that applies only to Java 11 (LTS)](cr/java_close_lts.png)

The [-Xshareclasses](xshareclasses.md) option is highly configurable, allowing you to specify where to create the cache, how much space to allocate for AOT code and more. You can also set the cache size by using the [-Xscmx](xscmx.md) option.


## Best practices for using `-Xshareclasses`

When you explicitly set the [-Xshareclasses](xshareclasses.md) option, it is good practice to set a number of parameters on the option:

- Set an application-specific cache name ([`-Xshareclasses:name=<name>`](xshareclasses.md#name)).

    If a cache with the specified name doesn't alkready exist, a new cache is created. This avoids sharing your application cache with a cache that is enabled by default (for example, by another application that doesn't set a name), and ensures that the size of your application cache can be set appropriately and that cache space is used exclusively for your application.

    <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Note:** A default cache might already exist and therefore you cannot change its size by using the [`-Xscmx`](xscmx.md) option, which has no effect on a pre-existing cache.

- Set an application-specific cache directory ([`-Xshareclasses:cacheDir=<directory>`](xshareclasses.md#cachedir)). 

    This avoids sharing the default cache directory with the default cache, or other application caches that don't set a cache directory, and means that your application is unaffected by the user running [`java -Xshareclasses:destroyAll`](xshareclasses.md#destroyall-cache-utility).

- Ensure that the cache directory permissions are set appropriately ([`-Xshareclasses:cacheDirPerm`](xshareclasses.md#cachedirperm)).

    It is good practice to explicitly set permissions for the cache directory.

- Set the [`-Xshareclasses:nonfatal`](xshareclasses.md#nonfatal) option.

    This option means that your application can start even if there is a problem opening or creating the shared cache, in which case, the VM might be able to start *without* class data sharing.

## Support for custom class loaders

Classes are shared by the bootstrap class loader internally in the OpenJ9 VM. If you are using a custom class loader, you can use the Java Helper API to find and store classes in the shared class cache.

For more information, see [Using the Java Helper API](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_8.0.0/com.ibm.java.vm.80.doc/docs/shrc_pd_helper.html).

## Cache utilities

Several utilities are provided for managing active caches, which are invoked by specifying `-Xshareclasses` suboptions. These utilities control the following types of operations:

- Adjust the minimum and maximum amount of cache space reserved for AOT or JIT data.
- Adjust the soft maximum size of the cache.
- Create snapshots of a cache.
- Create a cache from a snapshot.
- Remove caches and cache snapshots.
- List all the compatible and incompatible caches and snapshots.
- For problem determination, invalidate and revalidate AOT methods that cause a failure in an application.
- For problem determination, provide information to analyze the contents of a shared classes cache.

For more information, see [-Xshareclasses](xshareclasses.md).
