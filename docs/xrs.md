# -Xrs

Prevents the Eclipse OpenJ9&trade; runtime environment from handling any internally or externally generated signals such as `SIGSEGV` and `SIGABRT`. Any signals that are raised are handled by the default operating system handlers, which you might want if you are using a debugger such as GDB or WinDbg to diagnose problems in JNI code.

Disabling signal handling in the OpenJ9 VM reduces performance by approximately 2-4%, depending on the application.

:fontawesome-solid-pencil:{: .note aria-hidden="true"} **Note:** Setting this option prevents dumps being generated by the OpenJ9 VM for signals such as `SIGSEGV` and `SIGABRT`, because the VM is no longer intercepting these signals. Do not use the `-Xrs` option with the following options:

- [`-XX:+HandleSIGABRT`](xxhandlesigabrt.md)
- [`-XX:+HandleSIGUSR2`](xxhandlesigusr2.md)

An error is thrown if either of the options is enabled together with the `-Xrs` option. To resolve this error, one of the options should be disabled.

## Syntax

        -Xrs
        -Xrs:sync

## Parameters

: If you specify the `sync` parameter:

    - **On AIX&reg;, Linux&reg;, macOS&reg;, and z/OS&reg; systems:** Disables signal handling in the VM for `SIGSEGV`, `SIGFPE`, `SIGBUS`, `SIGILL`, `SIGTRAP`, and `SIGABRT` signals. However, the VM still handles the `SIGQUIT` and `SIGTERM` signals, among others.
    - **On Windows&trade; systems:** Hardware exceptions are not handled by the OpenJ9 VM when this option is specified. However, the Windows CTRL\_BREAK\_EVENT signal, triggered by the Ctrl-Break key combination, is still handled by the VM.

    **Linux and macOS systems** always use the `SIGUSR1` signal.
