# -Xlockword

Test whether performance optimizations are negatively impacting an application.

## Syntax

        -Xlockword:<parameters>

## Parameters

### `mode`

        -Xlockword:mode=all
        -Xlockword:mode=default

Locking optimizations typically reduce memory usage and improve performance. However, there might be some situations where a smaller heap size is achieved for an application, but overall application performance decreases.

For example, if your application synchronizes on objects that are not typically synchronized on, such as `Java.lang.String`, run the following test:  
Use the following command-line option to revert to behavior that is closer to earlier versions and monitor application performance:

    -Xlockword:mode=all

If performance does not improve, remove the previous command-line options or use the following command-line option to reestablish the new behavior:

    -Xlockword:mode=default

### `nolockword`

        -Xlockword:nolockword=<class_name>

: Removes the lockword from object instances of the class `<class_name>`, reducing the space required for these objects. However, this action might have an adverse effect on synchronization for those objects.

    You should only use this option for troubleshooting.

### `what`

        -Xlockword:what

: Shows the current lockword configuration.
