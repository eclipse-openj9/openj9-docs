# -XX:ParallelGCThread

This Oracle HotSpot option specifies the number of threads that are used during parallel operations of the default garbage collector. This option is recognized by OpenJ9 and provided for compatibility.

:fontawesome-solid-pencil-alt:{: .note aria-hidden="true"} **Notes:**

This option enforces the thread count and cannot be used with the [`-XX:+AdaptiveGCThreading`](xxadaptivegcthreading.md) option, which enables the garbage collector to adjust the number of parallel threads based on heuristics. If you want to use [`-XX:+AdaptiveGCThreading`](xxadaptivegcthreading.md), use [`-XX:ParallelGCMaxThreads`](xxparallelgcmaxthreads.md) instead of `-XX:ParallelGCThreads`.

## Syntax

        -XX:ParallelGCThreads=<number>

Where `<number>` is the number of threads that are used for parallel operations. 

Within OpenJ9 this option is directly mapped to [`-Xgcthreads`](xgcthreads.md).
