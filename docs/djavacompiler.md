# -Djava.compiler

This Oracle HotSpot property is used for loading a JIT compiler from a named, native library. This option can be used on the command line to specify the JIT compiler for the OpenJ9 VM.

## Syntax

        -Djava.compiler=j9jit29


<!-- OLD: 
## Explanation

Enable JIT compilation by setting to `j9jit<vm_version>`, where `<vm_version>` is the version of the J9 virtual machine. Use only digits, for example "29" for VM version 2.9. Check the output of the `java -version` command to confirm your VM level. (Equivalent to `â€“Xjit`).-->
