# -Dcom.ibm.oti.shared.SharedClassGlobalFilterClass


This system property applies a global filter to all non-bootstrap class loaders that share classes.

## Syntax

        -Dcom.ibm.oti.shared.SharedClassGlobalFilterClass=<filter_class_name>

This property is not set by default.

## Explanation

A filter can be used to decide which classes are found and stored by a custom class loader in a shared classes cache. The filter is applied to a particular package by implementing the `SharedClassFilter` interface.
