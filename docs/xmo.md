# -Xmo / -Xmoi / -Xmos / -Xmox


Sets the size and behavior of the old (tenure) heap when using `-Xgcpolicy:gencon`.

You can use the `-verbose:sizes` option to find out the values that the VM is currently using.

## Syntax

| Setting       | Effect                                         | Default                   |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `-Xmo<size>`  | Equivalent to setting both `-Xmos` and `-Xmox` | not set                   |
| `-Xmoi<size>` | Set increment size of old (tenure) heap        | See **Note**              |
| `-Xmos<size>` | Set initial size of old (tenure) heap          | 75% of [`-Xms`](xms.md)   |
| `-Xmox<size>` | Set maximum size of old (tenure) heap          | Same as [`-Xmx`](xms.md)  |

:fontawesome-solid-pencil-alt:{: .note aria-hidden="true"} **Note:** By default, the increment size (`-Xmoi`) is calculated on the expansion size, set by [`-Xmine`](xmine.md) and [`-Xminf`](xminf.md).  If you set `-Xmoi` to zero, no expansion is allowed.

See [Using -X command-line options](x_jvm_commands.md) for more information about the `<size>` parameter.

:fontawesome-solid-exclamation-triangle:{: .warn aria-hidden="true"} **Restriction:** If you try to set `-Xmo` with either `-Xmos` or `-Xmox`, the VM does not start, returning an error.
