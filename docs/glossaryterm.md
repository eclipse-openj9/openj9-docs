# Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|---------------|------------|
| **Agent** | A component loaded into a VM to perform tasks like monitoring, profiling, or diagnostics. |
| **AgentLoadException** | Exception thrown when an agent fails to load through the Attach API. |
| **Allocator** | Manages pools of free memory and allocates storage in the Java heap for objects that are requested by applications, libraries, or the VM. |
| **Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) Compiler** | Dynamically compiles Java methods into native code at runtime and stores them in the shared classes cache. This compilation and storage improves startup performance for subsequent runs by avoiding interpretation. |
| **Area-based Heap** | Divides the heap into nursery and tenure areas to optimize garbage collection based on object lifespan. |
| **Arraylet** | A structure for storing large arrays in fragmented heaps, consisting of a spine and leaves. Helps avoid contiguous memory allocation. |
| **Attach API** | Java API that allows a running VM to be connected to by another VM to load agents for monitoring or diagnostics. |
| **Class Data Sharing (CDS)** | VM feature that shares class metadata between VM instances to reduce startup time and memory usage. |
| **Classpath (`-classpath`)** | Specifies the search path for application classes and resources. |
| **Compressed References** | A memory optimization technique that stores object references in 32-bit format on 64-bit systems to reduce memory footprint. |
| **CRIU (Checkpoint/Restore In Userspace)** | Linux tool for checkpointing and restoring processes that run by using OpenJ9. |
| **CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture)** | NVIDIA's parallel computing platform that allows Java apps to offload tasks to GPUs. |
| **CUDA4J** | A technology or API within OpenJ9 that facilitates GPU acceleration for Java applications by using NVIDIA's CUDA platform. It allows Java programs to offload compute-intensive tasks to GPUs. |
| **Dynamic Agent Loading** | Loading agents into a running VM without restarting it, controlled through the `-XX:+EnableDynamicAgentLoading` option. |
| **Garbage Collector (GC)** | Reclaims memory by removing objects that are no longer referenced. Different GC policies determine its behavior. |
| **GC Policy** | A strategy used by the garbage collector to manage memory. Examples include `gencon`, `optavgpause`, and `balanced`. |
| **Health Center** | IBM tool for monitoring Java applications using the Attach API. |
| **Heap Configuration** | Defines the structure of the Java heap, which can be flat or divided into areas or regions. |
| **Heap Expansion and Contraction** | The VM grows or shrinks the heap based on memory needs and GC activity, which is controlled by options, such as `-Xminf` and `-Xmaxf`. |
| **Heap Lock** | A synchronization mechanism to prevent concurrent threads from accessing the same memory area during allocation. |
| **Heap Sizing** | Refers to setting initial and maximum heap sizes by using options, such as `-Xms` and `-Xmx`, with finer tuning for specific areas. |
| **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler** | Compiler that converts bytecode to native code at runtime for performance. |
| **LOA (Large Object Area)** | A heap subdivision for large object allocation. Its size is dynamically adjusted to avoid allocation failures. |
| **OpenJ9** | Eclipse Foundation's open source VM optimized for performance and memory efficiency. |
| **OpenSSL** | The cryptographic library that is used in OpenJ9 builds for secure communication and acceleration. |
| **OutOfMemoryError** | An exception thrown when the VM cannot allocate memory due to insufficient heap space. |
| **Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)**  | Standards specified by the IEEE Computer Society to maintain compatibility between operating systems. Enables the portability of software across different UNIX-like operating systems and other POSIX-compliant systems.            |
| **POSIX File Permissions** | UNIX file access control standard used to secure Attach API directories. |
| **Region-based Heap** | Divides the heap into many equal-sized regions to manage object generations. Used by `balanced` and `metronome` GC policies. |
| **Shared Classes Cache** | A storage area used to hold AOT-compiled methods and other class data to enable faster application startup. |
| **Small Object Allocation** | The process of allocating memory for objects that are typically smaller than 64 KB in a designated part of the heap called the Small Object Area (SOA). |
| **SOA (Small Object Area)** | A heap subdivision for small object allocation. Allocation failures here trigger garbage collection. |
| **Sticky Bit** | UNIX permission setting that restricts deletion or renaming of files in a directory to the file owner or root. |
| **System Temporary Directory** | Directory that is used by Attach API to store temporary files for communication between VMs. |
| **Thread Local Heap (TLH)** | A thread-specific memory cache that allows memory allocation without acquiring the heap lock, thus improving performance. |
