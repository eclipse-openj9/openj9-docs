This repository contains the source files for the [Eclipse OpenJ9 user documentation](http://www.eclipse.org/openj9/docs).
The user documentation tells you how to configure, tune, and diagnose problems with
an OpenJDK that has been built with the OpenJ9 Java virtual machine.

New to Eclipse OpenJ9? Here are a few links to get you started:

- Visit the [Eclipse OpenJ9 website](http://www.eclipse.org/openj9) to find out more.
- Read the [Getting started](https://www.eclipse.org/openj9/docs/introduction/) topic in our user documentation.
- Grab an OpenJDK binary that embeds OpenJ9 from  [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html?variant=openjdk8&jvmVariant=openj9).

The files in this repository are authored in markdown format and built using
[Mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) with the [MkDocs-material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). Draft documentation for the next release is hosted via the gh-pages branch of this repository at the following URL: https://eclipse.github.io/openj9-docs/).

We welcome contributions to the user documentation. Please follow our
[Contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
